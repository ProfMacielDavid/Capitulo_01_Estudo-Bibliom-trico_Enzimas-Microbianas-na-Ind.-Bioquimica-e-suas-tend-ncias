AB  - Pharmaceutical biotechnology has a long tradition and is rooted in the last 
      century, first exemplified by penicillin and streptomycin as low molecular weight 
      biosynthetic compounds. Today, pharmaceutical biotechnology still has its 
      fundamentals in fermentation and bioprocessing, but the paradigmatic change 
      affected by biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences has led to an updated 
      definition. The biotechnology revolution redrew the research, development, 
      production and even marketing processes of drugs. Powerful new instruments and 
      biotechnology related scientific disciplines (genomics, proteomics) make it 
      possible to examine and exploit the behavior of proteins and molecules. 
      Recombinant DNA (rDNA) technologies (genetic, protein, and metabolic engineering) 
      allow the production of a wide range of peptides, proteins, and biochemicals from 
      naturally nonproducing cells. This technology, now approximately 25 years old, is 
      becoming one of the most important technologies developed in the 20(th) century. 
      Pharmaceutical products and industrial enzymes were the first biotech products on 
      the world market made by means of rDNA. Despite important advances regarding rDNA 
      applications in mammalian cells, yeasts still represent attractive hosts for the 
      production of heterologous proteins. In this review we describe these processes.

AB  - Nature uses enzymes to build and convert biomass; mankind uses the same enzymes 
      and produces them on a large scale to make optimum use of biomass in 
      biorefineries. Bacterial α-amylases and fungal glucoamylases have been the 
      workhorses of starch biorefineries for many decades. Pullulanases were introduced 
      in the 1980s. Proteases, cellulases, hemicellulases, and phytases have been on 
      the market for a few years as process aids, improving yields, performance, and 
      costs. Detailed studies of the complex chemical structures of biomass and of the 
      physicochemical limitations of industrial biorefineries have led enzyme 
      developers to produce novel tailor-made solutions for improving yield and 
      profitability in the industry. This chapter reviews the development of enzyme 
      applications in the major starch biorefining processes.

TI  - Nanotechnology and enzyme immobilization: a review.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/acda35 [doi]
AB  - The synergy between enzymes and nanotechnology (nano-biocatalysts) has created 
      some of the most promising biomaterials fabricated by synergistically 
      incorporating advanced nano-biotechnology. The incorporation of enzymes into 
      nanotechnology is of great significance for making nanomaterials that are rarely 
      harmful to the environment. However, the unique/specific physicochemical 
      characteristics and supramolecular nature ascribed to functional nanostructures 
      (nanomaterials), have made them novel, interesting, and exceptional matrices for 
      the creation of nano-biocatalysts. These have a lot of potential for improving 
      the enzyme stability, function, efficiency, kinetic characteristics, 
      vulnerability to diffusional constraints, and engineering performance in 
      bioprocessing. Hence, the nano-biocatalysts developed contain exceptional 
      properties with many potential applications in diverse fields. This review covers 
      a wide range of the nanotechnology and enzyme technology involved in producing 
      nano-biocatalysts, including different mechanisms, strategies in nanomaterial 
      enzyme immobilization, and various nanocarriers, as well as recent developments 
      in controlling enzyme activity. The vast range of potential applications of 
      nano-biocatalysts in various fields, including food, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, 
      and bioremediation, has been discussed.

TI  - Upstream and Downstream Bioprocessing in Enzyme Technology.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16010038 [doi]
LID - 38
AB  - The development of biotransformation must integrate upstream and downstream 
      processes. Upstream bioprocessing will influence downstream bioprocessing. It is 
      essential to consider this because downstream processes can constitute the 
      highest cost in bioprocessing. This review comprehensively overviews the most 
      critical aspects of upstream and downstream bioprocessing in enzymatic 
      biocatalysis. The main upstream processes discussed are enzyme production, enzyme 
      immobilization methodologies, solvent selection, and statistical optimization 
      methodologies. The main downstream processes reviewed in this work are 
      biocatalyst recovery and product separation and purification. The correct 
      selection and combination of upstream and downstream methodologies will allow the 
      development of a sustainable and highly productive system.

AB  - Microbial enzymes have an indispensable role in producing foods, pharmaceuticals, 
      and other commercial goods. Many novel enzymes have been reported from all 
      domains of life, such as plants, microbes, and animals. Nonetheless, industrially 
      desirable enzymes of microbial origin are limited. This review article discusses 
      the classifications, applications, sources, and challenges of most demanded 
      industrial enzymes such as pectinases, cellulase, lipase, and protease. In 
      addition, the production of novel enzymes through protein engineering 
      technologies such as directed evolution, rational, and de novo design, for the 
      improvement of existing industrial enzymes is also explored. We have also 
      explored the role of metagenomics, nanotechnology, OMICs, and machine learning 
      approaches in the bioprospecting of novel enzymes. Overall, this review covers 
      the basics of biocatalysts in industrial and healthcare applications and provides 
      an overview of existing microbial enzyme optimization tools. KEY POINTS: • 
      Microbial bioactive molecules are vital for therapeutic and industrial 
      applications. • High-throughput OMIC is the most proficient approach for novel 
      enzyme discovery. • Comprehensive databases and efficient machine learning models 
      are the need of the hour to fast forward de novo enzyme design and discovery.

TI  - Recent Developments in Industrial Mycozymes: A Current Appraisal.
PG  - 81-105
LID - 10.1080/21501203.2021.1974111 [doi]
AB  - Fungi, being natural decomposers, are the most potent, ubiquitous and versatile 
      sources of industrial enzymes. About 60% of market share of industrial enzymes is 
      sourced from filamentous fungi and yeasts. Mycozymes (myco-fungus; zymes-enzymes) 
      are playing a pivotal role in several industrial applications and a number of 
      potential applications are in the offing. The field of mycozyme production, while 
      maintaining the old traditional methods, has also witnessed a sea change due to 
      advents in recombinant DNA technology, optimisation protocols, fermentation 
      technology and systems biology. Consolidated bioprocessing of abundant 
      lignocellulosic biomass and complex polysaccharides is being explored at an 
      unprecedented pace and a number of mycozymes of diverse fungal origins are being 
      explored using suitable platforms. The present review attempts to revisit the 
      current status of various mycozymes, screening and production strategies and 
      applications thereof.

AB  - Biotransformation with enzymes and de novo syntheses with whole-cell biocatalysts 
      each have specific advantages. These can be combined to achieve processes with 
      optimal performance. A recent approach is to perform bioconversion processes and 
      enzymatic catalysis simultaneously in one-pot. This is a well-established process 
      in the biorefinery, where starchy or cellulosic material is degraded 
      enzymatically and simultaneously used as substrate for microbial cultivations. 
      This procedure leads to a number of advantages like saving in time but also in 
      the needed equipment (e.g., reaction vessels). In addition, the inhibition or 
      side-reaction of high sugar concentrations can be overcome by combining the 
      processes. These benefits of coupling microbial conversion and enzymatic 
      biotransformation can also be transferred to other processes for example in the 
      sector of biofuel production or in the food industry. However, finding a 
      compromise between the different requirements of the two processes is challenging 
      in some cases. This article summarises the latest developments and process 
      variations.

AB  - Lignin, the most abundant renewable aromatic compound in nature, is an excellent 
      feedstock for value-added bioproducts manufacturing; while the intrinsic 
      heterogeneity and recalcitrance of which hindered the efficient lignin 
      biorefinery and utilization. Compared with chemical processing, bioprocessing 
      with microbial and enzymatic catalysis is a clean and efficient method for lignin 
      depolymerization and conversion. Generally, lignin bioprocessing involves lignin 
      decomposition to lignin-based aromatics via extracellular microbial enzymes and 
      further converted to value-added bioproducts through microbial metabolism. In the 
      review, the most recent advances in degradation and conversion of lignin to 
      value-added bioproducts catalyzed by microbes and enzymes were summarized. The 
      lignin-degrading microorganisms of white-rot fungi, brown-rot fungi, soft-rot 
      fungi, and bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were comparatively 
      analyzed. The catalytic metabolism of the microbial lignin-degrading enzymes of 
      laccase, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, biphenyl bond cleavage enzyme, 
      versatile peroxidase, and β-etherize was discussed. The microbial metabolic 
      process of H-lignin, G-lignin, S-lignin based derivatives, protocatechuic acid, 
      and catechol was reviewed. Lignin was depolymerized to lignin-derived aromatic 
      compounds by the secreted enzymes of fungi and bacteria, and the aromatics were 
      converted to value-added compounds through microbial catalysis and metabolic 
      engineering. The review also proposes new insights for future work to overcome 
      the recalcitrance of lignin and convert it to value-added bioproducts by 
      microbial and enzymatic catalysis.

TI  - Microbial Enzymes in Industrial Biotechnology: Sources, Production, and 
      Significant Applications of Lipases.
LID - 10.1093/jimb/kuaf010 [doi]
LID - kuaf010
AB  - The variety of microorganisms represents the most prevalent sources utilized 
      within diverse industries and research fields. Enzymes with microorganisms are 
      applied in the use of industrial biotechnology. Since the dawn of civilization, 
      there are techniques like extraction and fermentation that use plant or bacterial 
      enzymes as well as other byproducts. Enzymes, the natural catalysts, are 
      intricately involved in many aspects of life. Enzymes pose remarkable specificity 
      for their substrate, which implies that these metabolic cycles in a living cell 
      need to be executed by a team working in collaboration. The major sources of 
      these enzymes are yeast, some fungi and bacteria. Just like all living forms, 
      microbes interact with their environment in which they must live in order to 
      survive. A large number of microorganisms that are capable of producing great 
      varieties of enzymes are important in the production of bread, cheese, yogurt, 
      beer, and many other foods. One of the most widely used lipolytic enzyme is 
      lipase from various sources including food and dairy industry, leather, 
      detergent, pulp and paper, bioenergy and even pharma. With the latest innovation 
      in biotechnology, the need for organisms that produce different commercially 
      important lipases which other strains of lipases do is increasing. Lipases 
      produced from microbial cells have a major industrial significance because of 
      their property of versatility and ease of mass production. This review seeks to 
      clarify the sources of microorganisms, lipase production and purification 
      processes, as well as the environmental and industrial uses of lipase enzymes. 
      ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY: This manuscript explores the diverse microbial sources of 
      lipase, their production processes and the crucial applications in industries 
      such as food, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels.

AB  - Keratin is an insoluble and protein-rich epidermal material found in e.g. 
      feather, wool, hair. It is produced in substantial amounts as co-product from 
      poultry processing plants and pig slaughterhouses. Keratin is packed by disulfide 
      bonds and hydrogen bonds. Based on the secondary structure, keratin can be 
      classified into α-keratin and β-keratin. Keratinases (EC 3.4.-.- peptide 
      hydrolases) have major potential to degrade keratin for sustainable recycling of 
      the protein and amino acids. Currently, the known keratinolytic enzymes belong to 
      at least 14 different protease families: S1, S8, S9, S10, S16, M3, M4, M14, M16, 
      M28, M32, M36, M38, M55 (MEROPS database). The various keratinolytic enzymes act 
      via endo-attack (proteases in families S1, S8, S16, M4, M16, M36), exo-attack 
      (proteases in families S9, S10, M14, M28, M38, M55) or by action only on 
      oligopeptides (proteases in families M3, M32), respectively. Other enzymes, 
      particularly disulfide reductases, also play a key role in keratin degradation as 
      they catalyze the breakage of disulfide bonds for better keratinase catalysis. 
      This review aims to contribute an overview of keratin biomass as an enzyme 
      substrate and a systematic analysis of currently sequenced keratinolytic enzymes 
      and their classification and reaction mechanisms. We also summarize and discuss 
      keratinase assays, available keratinase structures and finally examine the 
      available data on uses of keratinases in practical biorefinery protein upcycling 
      applications.

AB  - Cellulases play a promising role in the bioconversion of renewable 
      lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars which are subsequently fermented 
      to biofuels and other value-added chemicals. Besides biofuel industries, they are 
      also in huge demand in textile, detergent, and paper and pulp industries. Low 
      titres of cellulase production and processing are the main issues that contribute 
      to high enzyme cost. The success of ethanol-based biorefinery depends on high 
      production titres and the catalytic efficiency of cellulases functional at 
      elevated temperatures with acid/alkali tolerance and the low cost. In view of 
      their wider application in various industrial processes, stable cellulases that 
      are active at elevated temperatures in the acidic-alkaline pH ranges, and organic 
      solvents and salt tolerance would be useful. This review provides a recent update 
      on the advances made in thermostable cellulases. Developments in their sources, 
      characteristics and mechanisms are updated. Various methods such as rational 
      design, directed evolution, synthetic & system biology and immobilization 
      techniques adopted in evolving cellulases with ameliorated thermostability and 
      characteristics are also discussed. The wide range of applications of 
      thermostable cellulases in various industrial sectors is described.

AB  - The speed of sequencing of microbial genomes and metagenomes is providing an ever 
      increasing resource for the identification of new robust biocatalysts with 
      industrial applications for many different aspects of industrial biotechnology. 
      Using 'natures catalysts' provides a sustainable approach to chemical synthesis 
      of fine chemicals, general chemicals such as surfactants and new consumer-based 
      materials such as biodegradable plastics. This provides a sustainable and 'green 
      chemistry' route to chemical synthesis which generates no toxic waste and is 
      environmentally friendly. In addition, enzymes can play important roles in other 
      applications such as carbon dioxide capture, breakdown of food and other waste 
      streams to provide a route to the concept of a 'circular economy' where nothing 
      is wasted. The use of improved bioinformatic approaches and the development of 
      new rapid enzyme activity screening methodology can provide an endless resource 
      for new robust industrial biocatalysts.This mini-review will discuss several 
      recent case studies where industrial enzymes of 'high priority' have been 
      identified and characterised. It will highlight specific hydrolase enzymes and 
      recent case studies which have been carried out within our group in Exeter.

AB  - The production of banana peel by the food-processing industry is substantial and 
      the disposal of this waste material has become a matter of concern. However, 
      recent studies have demonstrated that banana peel is a rich source of 
      biologically active compounds that can be transformed into valuable products. 
      This review aims to explore the potential of converting banana peel into valuable 
      products and provides a comprehensive analysis of the physical and chemical 
      composition of banana peel. Additionally, the utilization of banana peel as a 
      substrate to produce animal feed, bio fertilizer, dietary fibers, renewable 
      energy, industrial enzymes, and nanomaterials has been extensively studied. 
      According to the researches that has been done so far, it is clear that banana 
      peel has a broad range of applications and its effective utilization through 
      biorefinery strategies can maximize its economic benefits. Based on previous 
      studies, A plan for feasibility of a banana peel biorefinery has been put up 
      which suggest its potential as a valuable source of renewable energy and 
      high-value products. The utilization of banana peel through biorefinery 
      strategies can provide a sustainable solution for waste management and contribute 
      to the development of a circular economy.

TI  - Harnessing the sponge microbiome for industrial biocatalysts.
PG  - 8131-8154
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10817-3 [doi]
AB  - Within the marine sphere, host-associated microbiomes are receiving growing 
      attention as prolific sources of novel biocatalysts. Given the known biocatalytic 
      potential of poriferan microbial inhabitants, this review focuses on enzymes from 
      the sponge microbiome, with special attention on their relevant properties and 
      the wide range of their potential biotechnological applications within various 
      industries. Cultivable bacterial and filamentous fungal isolates account for the 
      majority of the enzymatic sources. Hydrolases, mainly glycoside hydrolases and 
      carboxylesterases, are the predominant reported group of enzymes, with varying 
      degrees of tolerance to alkaline pH and growing salt concentrations being common. 
      Prospective areas for the application of these microbial enzymes include 
      biorefinery, detergent, food and effluent treatment industries. Finally, 
      alternative strategies to identify novel biocatalysts from the sponge microbiome 
      are addressed, with an emphasis on modern -omics-based approaches that are 
      currently available in the enzyme research arena. By providing this current 
      overview of the field, we hope to not only increase the appetite of researchers 
      to instigate forthcoming studies but also to stress how basic and applied 
      research can pave the way for new biocatalysts from these symbiotic microbial 
      communities in a productive fashion. KEY POINTS: • The sponge microbiome is a 
      burgeoning source of industrial biocatalysts. • Sponge microbial enzymes have 
      useful habitat-related traits for several industries. • Strategies are provided 
      for the future discovery of microbial enzymes from sponges.

AB  - Over billions of years, the ocean has been regarded as the origin of life on 
      Earth. The ocean includes the largest range of habitats, hosting the most 
      life-forms. Competition amongst microorganisms for space and nutrients in the 
      marine environment is a powerful selective force, which has led to evolution. The 
      evolution prompted the marine microorganisms to generate multifarious enzyme 
      systems to adapt to the complicated marine environments. Therefore, marine 
      microbial enzymes can offer novel biocatalysts with extraordinary properties. 
      This review deals with the research and development work investigating the 
      occurrence and bioprocessing of marine microbial enzymes.

AB  - Lignocellulosic materials form the building block of 50% of plant biomass 
      comprising non-chewable agri-components like wheat straw, rice stubbles, wood 
      shavings and other crop residues. The degradation of lignin, cellulose and 
      hemicellulose is complicated and presently being done by chemical process for 
      industrial application through a very energy intensive process. Lignin 
      degradation is primarily an oxidative process where the enzyme lignin peroxidase 
      digests the polymer into smaller fragments. Being a recalcitrant component, 
      higher lignin content poses a challenge of lower recovery of product for 
      industrial use. Globally, the scientists are working on leveraging fungal 
      biotechnology for using the lignocellulose degrading enzymes secreted by 
      actinomycetes and basidiomycetes fungal groups. Enzymes contributing to 
      degradation of lignin are mainly performing the function of modifying the lignin 
      and degrading the lignin. Ligninolytic enzymes do not act as an independent 
      reaction but are vital to complete the degradation process. Microbial enzyme 
      technology is an emerging green tool in industrial biotechnology for commercial 
      application. Bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass is challenged by 
      limitations in enzymatic and conversion process where pretreatment and separation 
      steps are done to remove lignin and hydrolyze carbohydrate into fermentable 
      sugars. This review highlights recent advances in molecular biotechnology, lignin 
      valorization, sequencing, decipher microbial membership, and characterize enzyme 
      diversity through 'omics' techniques. Emerging techniques to characterize the 
      interwoven metabolism and spatial interactions between anaerobes are also 
      reviewed, which will prove critical to developing a predictive understanding of 
      anaerobic communities to guide in microbiome engineering This requires more 
      synergistic collaborations from microbial biotechnologists, bioprocess engineers, 
      enzymologists, and other biotechnological fields.

TI  - Surfactants, Biosurfactants, and Non-Catalytic Proteins as Key Molecules to 
      Enhance Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Lignocellulosic Biomass.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27238180 [doi]
LID - 8180
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has remained a latent alternative resource to be 
      the main substitute for oil and its derivatives in a biorefinery concept. 
      However, its complex structure and the underdeveloped technologies for its 
      large-scale processing keep it in a state of constant study trying to establish a 
      consolidated process. In intensive processes, enzymes have been shown to be 
      important molecules for the fractionation and conversion of LCB into biofuels and 
      high-value-added molecules. However, operational challenges must be overcome 
      before enzyme technology can be the main resource for obtaining second-generation 
      sugars. The use of additives is shown to be a suitable strategy to improve the 
      saccharification process. This review describes the mechanisms, roles, and 
      effects of using additives, such as surfactants, biosurfactants, and 
      non-catalytic proteins, separately and integrated into the enzymatic hydrolysis 
      process of lignocellulosic biomass. In doing so, it provides a technical 
      background in which operational biomass processing hurdles such as solids and 
      enzymatic loadings, pretreatment burdens, and the unproductive adsorption 
      phenomenon can be addressed.

AB  - A continuous increase in the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is causing serious 
      threats to the environment and life on the earth, and CO(2) is one of the major 
      candidates. Reducing the excess CO(2) by converting into industrial products 
      could be beneficial for the environment and also boost up industrial growth. In 
      particular, the conversion of CO(2) into methanol is very beneficial as it is 
      cheaper to produce from biomass, less inflammable, and advantageous to many 
      industries. Application of various plants, algae, and microbial enzymes to 
      recycle the CO(2) and using these enzymes separately along with CO(2)-phillic 
      materials and chemicals can be a sustainable solution to reduce the global carbon 
      footprint. Materials such as MOFs, porphyrins, and nanomaterials are also used 
      widely for CO(2) absorption and conversion into methanol. Thus, a combination of 
      enzymes and materials which convert the CO(2) into methanol could energize the 
      CO(2) utilization. The CO(2) to methanol conversion utilizes carbon better than 
      the conventional syngas and the reaction yields fewer by-products. The methanol 
      produced can further be utilized as a clean-burning fuel, in pharmaceuticals, 
      automobiles and as a general solvent in various industries etc. This makes 
      methanol an ideal fuel in comparison to the conventional petroleum-based ones and 
      it is advantageous for a safer and cleaner environment. In this review article, 
      various aspects of the circular economy with the present scenario of 
      environmental crisis will also be considered for large-scale sustainable 
      biorefinery of methanol production from atmospheric CO(2).

      the existing microbial enzymes to suit the present day needs of the industry. The 
      redesigning of industrially useful enzymes for improving their performance has 
      become a challenge because bioinformatics databases have been revealing new facts 
      on a day-to-day basis. Modification of the existing enzymes has become a trend 
      for fine tuning of biocatalysts in the biotech industry. Hydrolases are employed 
      in pharmaceutical, biofuel, detergent, food and feed industries that 
      significantly contribute to the global annual revenue, and therefore, the 
      emphasis has been on engineering them. Although a large data is accumulating on 
      making alterations in microbial enzymes, there is a lack of definite information 
      on redesigning industrial enzymes. This review focuses on the recent developments 
      in improving the characteristics of various biotechnologically important enzymes.

TI  - Biorefinery of waste orange peel.
PG  - 63-9
LID - 10.3109/07388550903425201 [doi]
AB  - Up to comparatively recently orange peel and the associated residual remnants of 
      membranes resulting from juice extraction represented a significant disposal 
      problem, especially in those regions where orange cultivation is a major 
      industry. However, recent research has demonstrated that orange peel waste 
      represents a potentially valuable resource that can be developed into high value 
      products. These developments are critically reviewed in this article. This 
      includes a summary of the chemical composition of the substrate and an assessment 
      of the range of applications in which the peel is deployed. Utilization as a 
      substrate to produce animal feed, fertilizer, essential oils, pectin, ethanol, 
      methane, industrial enzymes, and single cell protein is discussed. The 
      applications described together with those that will no doubt be developed in the 
      future, represent great opportunities to harness the economical benefit of this 
      agro-industrial waste and to develop even more efficient and sustainable systems. 
      A scheme of integrated utilization of orange peel in a biorefinery approach is 
      discussed together with some prediction of further necessary research.

TI  - Safety of the fungal workhorses of industrial biotechnology: update on the 
      mycotoxin and secondary metabolite potential of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus 
      oryzae, and Trichoderma reesei.
PG  - 9481-9515
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9354-1 [doi]
AB  - This review presents an update on the current knowledge of the secondary 
      metabolite potential of the major fungal species used in industrial 
      biotechnology, i.e., Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, and Trichoderma 
      reesei. These species have a long history of safe use for enzyme production. Like 
      most microorganisms that exist in a challenging environment in nature, these 
      fungi can produce a large variety and number of secondary metabolites. Many of 
      these compounds present several properties that make them attractive for 
      different industrial and medical applications. A description of all known 
      secondary metabolites produced by these species is presented here. Mycotoxins are 
      a very limited group of secondary metabolites that can be produced by fungi and 
      that pose health hazards in humans and other vertebrates when ingested in small 
      amounts. Some mycotoxins are species-specific. Here, we present scientific basis 
      for (1) the definition of mycotoxins including an update on their toxicity and 
      (2) the clarity on misclassification of species and their mycotoxin potential 
      reported in literature, e.g., A. oryzae has been wrongly reported as an aflatoxin 
      producer, due to misclassification of Aspergillus flavus strains. It is therefore 
      of paramount importance to accurately describe the mycotoxins that can 
      potentially be produced by a fungal species that is to be used as a production 
      organism and to ensure that production strains are not capable of producing 
      mycotoxins during enzyme production. This review is intended as a reference paper 
      for authorities, companies, and researchers dealing with secondary metabolite 
      assessment, risk evaluation for food or feed enzyme production, or considerations 
      on the use of these species as production hosts.

AB  - Industrial enzymes have become the core "chip" for bio-manufacturing technology. 
      Design and development of novel and efficient enzymes is the key to the 
      development of industrial biotechnology. The scientific basis for the innovative 
      design of industrial catalysts is an in-depth analysis of the structure-activity 
      relationship between enzymes and substrates, as well as their regulatory 
      mechanisms. With the development of bioinformatics and computational technology, 
      the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme can be solved by various calculation 
      methods. Subsequently, the specific regions of the structure can be rationally 
      reconstructed to improve the catalytic performance, which will further promote 
      the industrial application of the target enzyme. Computational simulation and 
      rational design based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship have 
      become the crucial technology for the preparation of high-efficiency industrial 
      enzymes. This review provides a brief introduction and discussion on various 
      calculation methods and design strategies as well as future trends.

TI  - Developing a Sustainable and Circular Bio-Based Economy in EU: By Partnering

      Climate, Environment & Biodiversity, and People & Business.
PG  - 619066

AB  - This paper gives an overview of development of the EU-bioeconomy, 2014-2020. The 
      Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the 
      full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, 
      industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. 
      The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added 
      products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based 
      chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars 
      of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme 
      technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, 
      conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE 
      are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural 
      development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change 
      mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework 
      conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of 
      circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014-2020) 
      are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and 
      aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including 
      higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. 
      Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding 
      instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research 
      involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific 
      recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win 
      CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE. In 
      contrast to fossil resources biological resources are found worldwide. In its 
      outset, circular bio-based economy, can be implemented all over, in a just 
      manner, not the least stimulating rural development.

AB  - Turkey is a country not usually associated with industrial biotechnology. 
      However, when current research potential in universities and other R & D centers 
      and particularly contributions made to the international literature since the 
      mid-1980s are taken into account, high-quality international-level work is now 
      commonplace, especially in areas such as industrial microbiology, enzyme 
      technology, biomaterials and biological wastewater treatment. Work in plant 
      biotechnology is at a relatively early stage, but is expected to become a rapidly 
      developing force in the near future. The present article documents current 
      potential in Turkey, based on significant publications produced during the last 8 
      years.

TI  - Use of immobilised biocatalysts in the processing of cheese whey.
PG  - 437-47
LID - 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2009.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Food processing industry operations need to comply with increasingly more 
      stringent environmental regulations related to the disposal or utilisation of 
      by-products and wastes. These include growing restrictions on land spraying with 
      agro-industrial wastes, and on disposal within landfill operations, and the 
      requirements to produce end products that are stabilised and hygienic. Much of 
      the material generated as wastes by the dairy processing industries contains 
      components that could be utilised as substrates and nutrients in a variety of 
      microbial/enzymatic processes, to give rise to added-value products. A good 
      example of a waste that has received considerable attention as a source of 
      added-value products is cheese whey. The carbohydrate reservoir of lactose (4-5%) 
      in whey and the presence of other essential nutrients make it a good natural 
      medium for the growth of microorganisms and a potential substrate for 
      bioprocessing through microbial fermentation. Immobilised cell and enzyme 
      technology has also been applied to whey bioconversion processes to improve the 
      economics of such processes. This review focuses upon the elaboration of a range 
      of immobilisation techniques that have been applied to produce valuable 
      whey-based products. A comprehensive literature survey is also provided to 
      illustrate numerous immobilisation procedures with particular emphasis upon 
      lactose hydrolysis, and ethanol and lactic acid production using immobilised 
      biocatalysts.

TI  - Manipulation of the microalgal chloroplast by genetic engineering for 
      biotechnological utilization as a green biofactory.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2567-8 [doi]
AB  - The chloroplast is an essential organelle in microalgae for conducting 
      photosynthesis, thus enabling the photoautotrophic growth of microalgae. In 
      addition to photosynthesis, the chloroplast is capable of various biochemical 
      processes for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and terpenoids. 
      Due to these attractive characteristics, there has been increasing interest in 
      the biotechnological utilization of microalgal chloroplast as a sustainable 
      alternative to the conventional production platforms used in industrial 
      biotechnology. Since the first demonstration of microalgal chloroplast 
      transformation, significant development has occurred over recent decades in the 
      manipulation of microalgal chloroplasts through genetic engineering. In the 
      present review, we describe the advantages of the microalgal chloroplast as a 
      production platform for various bioproducts, including recombinant proteins and 
      high-value metabolites, features of chloroplast genetic systems, and the 
      development of transformation methods, which represent important factors for gene 
      expression in the chloroplast. Furthermore, we address the expression of various 
      recombinant proteins in the microalgal chloroplast through genetic engineering, 
      including reporters, biopharmaceutical proteins, and industrial enzymes. Finally, 
      we present many efforts and achievements in the production of high-value 
      metabolites in the microalgal chloroplast through metabolic engineering. Based on 
      these efforts and advances, the microalgal chloroplast represents an economically 
      viable and sustainable platform for biotechnological applications in the near 
      future.

AB  - Over billions of years, the ocean is regarded as the origin of life on Earth, and 
      the ocean includes the largest habitats hosting the most life forms. Competition 
      among microorganisms for space and nutrients in the marine environment is a 
      powerful selective force, which has led to the evolution. The evolution prompts 
      the marine microorganisms to generate multifarious enzyme systems to adapt to the 
      complicated marine environments. Therefore, marine microbial enzymes can offer 
      novel biocatalysts with extraordinary properties. This review deals with the 
      research and development work done on the occurrence and bioprocessing of marine 
      microbial enzymes.

AB  - Malaysian enzyme industry is considered almost non-existence, although the import 
      volume is large. Realizing the importance of enzymes, encompassing a wide range 
      of applications in bioindustry, the development of home grown technologies for 
      enzyme production and applications becomes one of the national priorities in 
      industrial biotechnology. Enzyme production from indigenous microbial isolates 
      was performed either by submerged or solid state fermentation processes. Based on 
      its wide and unique spectrum of properties, enzymes have been developed for wide 
      applications in various industrial processes. The development of the enzyme 
      catalysed applications is based on the modification of the reaction systems to 
      enhance their catalytic activities. Some of the applications of the industrial 
      enzymes include the fine chemicals production, oleochemicals modification, 
      detergent formulation, enzymatic drinking of waste papers, animal feed 
      formulation and effluent treatment processes. Enzymes have also shown to be 
      successfully used as analytical tool in the determination of compounds in body 
      fluids. Although, most of these enzyme catalysed reactions were performed in 
      aqueous phase, the use of enzymes in organic solvents was found to be significant 
      for the production of new chemicals.

AB  - Enzymes are biological molecules that act as catalysts and speed up the 
      biochemical reactions. The world's biotechnological ventures are development of 
      enzyme productiveness, and advancement of novel techniques for thriving their 
      shelf existence. Nowadays, the most burning questions in enzyme technology are 
      how to improve the enzyme productivity and reuse them. The immobilization of 
      enzymes provides an excellent scope to reuse the enzymes several times to 
      increase productivity. The main aim of the present study is the establishment of 
      an immobilized multi-enzyme bio-system engineering process for the production of 
      High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) with an industrial focus. In this study, 
      multi-enzyme such as α-amylase, glucoamylase and glucose isomerase were 
      immobilized in various support matrices like sodium alginate, sawdust, sugarcane 
      bagasse, rice bran and combination of alginate with cellulosic materials. The 
      activities of the immobilized multi-enzyme system for the production of HFCS from 
      the starch solution were determined. The multi-enzyme immobilized in sodium 
      alginate shows better fructose conversion than free enzyme. Among the support 
      matrices, multi-enzyme immobilized in sawdust produced total 80.74 mg/mL of 
      fructose from starch solution and it was able to be used in several production 
      cycles. On the other hand, multi-enzyme immobilized in combination of sodium 
      alginate and sawdust produced the maximum amount of fructose (total 84.82 mg/mL). 
      The free enzyme produced 17.25 mg/mL of fructose from the starch solution in only 
      a single cycle. In this study a new fixed bed immobilized multi-enzyme bioreactor 
      system was developed for the production of HFCS directly from starch. This 
      finding will create a new opportunity for the application of immobilized 
      multi-enzyme systems in many sectors of industrial biotechnology.

TI  - deepNEC: a novel alignment-free tool for the identification and classification of 
      nitrogen biochemical network-related enzymes using deep learning.
LID - bbac071 [pii]

AB  - Nitrogen is essential for life and its transformations are an important part of 
      the global biogeochemical cycle. Being an essential nutrient, nitrogen exists in 
      a range of oxidation states from +5 (nitrate) to -3 (ammonium and 
      amino-nitrogen), and its oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by microbial 
      enzymes determine its environmental fate. The functional annotation of the genes 
      encoding the core nitrogen network enzymes has a broad range of applications in 
      metagenomics, agriculture, wastewater treatment and industrial biotechnology. 
      This study developed an alignment-free computational approach to determine the 
      predicted nitrogen biochemical network-related enzymes from the sequence itself. 
      We propose deepNEC, a novel end-to-end feature selection and classification model 
      training approach for nitrogen biochemical network-related enzyme prediction. The 
      algorithm was developed using Deep Learning, a class of machine learning 
      algorithms that uses multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the 
      raw input data. The derived protein sequence is used as an input, extracting 
      sequential and convolutional features from raw encoded protein sequences based on 
      classification rather than traditional alignment-based methods for enzyme 
      prediction. Two large datasets of protein sequences, enzymes and non-enzymes were 
      used to train the models with protein sequence features like amino acid 
      composition, dipeptide composition (DPC), conformation transition and 
      distribution, normalized Moreau-Broto (NMBroto), conjoint and quasi order, etc. 
      The k-fold cross-validation and independent testing were performed to validate 
      our model training. deepNEC uses a four-tier approach for prediction; in the 
      first phase, it will predict a query sequence as enzyme or non-enzyme; in the 
      second phase, it will further predict and classify enzymes into nitrogen 
      biochemical network-related enzymes or non-nitrogen metabolism enzymes; in the 
      third phase, it classifies predicted enzymes into nine nitrogen metabolism 
      classes; and in the fourth phase, it predicts the enzyme commission number out of 
      20 classes for nitrogen metabolism. Among all, the DPC + NMBroto hybrid feature 
      gave the best prediction performance (accuracy of 96.15% in k-fold training and 
      93.43% in independent testing) with an Matthews correlation coefficient (0.92 
      training and 0.87 independent testing) in phase I; phase II (accuracy of 99.71% 
      in k-fold training and 98.30% in independent testing); phase III (overall 
      accuracy of 99.03% in k-fold training and 98.98% in independent testing); phase 
      IV (overall accuracy of 99.05% in k-fold training and 98.18% in independent 
      testing), the DPC feature gave the best prediction performance. We have also 
      implemented a homology-based method to remove false negatives. All the models 
      have been implemented on a web server (prediction tool), which is freely

AB  - DyP-type peroxidases (DyPs) are microbial enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of 
      a wide range of substrates, including synthetic dyes, lignin-derived compounds, 
      and metals, such as Mn(2+) and Fe(2+), and have enormous biotechnological 
      potential in biorefineries. However, many questions on the molecular basis of 
      enzyme function and stability remain unanswered. In this work, high-resolution 
      structures of PpDyP wild-type and two engineered variants (6E10 and 29E4) 
      generated by directed evolution were obtained. The X-ray crystal structures 
      revealed the typical ferredoxin-like folds, with three heme access pathways, two 
      tunnels, and one cavity, limited by three long loops including catalytic 
      residues. Variant 6E10 displays significantly increased loops' flexibility that 
      favors function over stability: despite the considerably higher catalytic 
      efficiency, this variant shows poorer protein stability compared to wild-type and 
      29E4 variants. Constant-pH MD simulations revealed a more positively charged 
      microenvironment near the heme pocket of variant 6E10, particularly in the 
      neutral to alkaline pH range. This microenvironment affects enzyme activity by 
      modulating the pK (a) of essential residues in the heme vicinity and should 
      account for variant 6E10 improved activity at pH 7-8 compared to the wild-type 
      and 29E4 that show optimal enzymatic activity close to pH 4. Our findings shed 
      light on the structure-function relationships of DyPs at the molecular level, 
      including their pH-dependent conformational plasticity. These are essential for 
      understanding and engineering the catalytic properties of DyPs for future 
      biotechnological applications.

AB  - Tremendous explosion of population has led to about 200% increment of total 
      energy consumptions in last twenty-five years. Apart from conventional fossil 
      fuel as limited energy source, alternative non-conventional sources are being 
      explored worldwide to cater the energy requirement. Lignocellulosic biomass 
      conversion for biofuel production is an important alternative energy source due 
      to its abundance in nature and creating less harmful impacts on the environment 
      in comparison to the coal or petroleum-based sources. However, lignocellulose 
      biopolymer, the building block of plants, is a recalcitrant substance and 
      difficult to break into desirable products. Commonly used chemical and physical 
      methods for pretreating the substrate are having several limitations. Whereas, 
      utilizing microbial potential to hydrolyse the biomass is an interesting area of 
      research. Because of the complexity of substrate, several enzymes are required 
      that can act synergistically to hydrolyse the biopolymer producing components 
      like bioethanol or other energy substances. Exploring a range of microorganisms, 
      like bacteria, fungi, yeast etc. that utilizes lignocelluloses for their energy 
      through enzymatic breaking down the biomass, is one of the options. Scientists 
      are working upon designing organisms through genetic engineering tools to 
      integrate desired enzymes into a single organism (like bacterial cell). Studies 
      on designer cellulosomes and bacteria consortia development relating consolidated 
      bioprocessing are exciting to overcome the issue of appropriate lignocellulose 
      digestions. This review encompasses up to date information on recent developments 
      for effective microbial degradation processes of lignocelluloses for improved 
      utilization to produce biofuel (bioethanol in particular) from the most plentiful 
      substances of our planet.

AB  - The aggregation and precipitation of a soluble protein-within a motor neuron, or 
      a pharmaceutical vial, or even inside a industrial-scale hydrolysis chamber-is a 
      problem in human health and in biotechnology. A growing body of research is 
      suggesting that the magnitude of the net charge of a protein is a determinant of 
      the rate at which proteins self-assemble in solution into aggregates with 
      amorphous or fibrillar (or uncharacterized) morphologies. This chapter discusses 
      how this apparently simple electrostatic effect might explain-in part or 
      entirely-the pathogenicity of some mutations that cause familial protein 
      aggregation diseases-especially the familial forms of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis that are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide 
      dismutase-1 (SOD1). In parallel, this chapter also discusses how understanding 
      these electrostatic effects can guide the engineering of industrial enzymes (such 
      as alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis) into forms that are more resistant 
      to aggregation and thermal precipitation than the enzymes that are currently 
      used, for example, in the production of ethanol from starch or cellulose.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glucuronoyl esterase (GE) is an emerging enzyme that improves 
      fractionation of lignin-carbohydrate complexes. However, the commercial 
      availability of GE is limited, which hinders the research of GE-based 
      bioprocesses for its industrial application in lignocellulose biorefineries. This 
      study evaluated a workable, cost-effective, and commercially scalable production 
      strategy to improve the ease of GE-based research. This strategy consisted of a 
      constitutive and methanol-free enzyme production step coupled with a two-step 
      filtration process. The aim was to determine if this strategy can yield copious 
      amounts of GE, by secretion into the extracellular medium with an acceptable 
      purity that could allow its direct application. This approach was further 
      validated for cellobiose dehydrogenase, another emerging lignocellulose degrading 
      enzyme which is scarcely available at high cost. RESULTS: The secreted 
      recombinant enzymes were functionally produced in excess of levels previously 
      reported for constitutive production (1489-2780 mg L(-1)), and were secreted at 
      moderate to high percentages of the total extracellular protein (51-94%). The 
      constant glycerol feed, implemented during fed-batch fermentation, lead to a 
      decline in growth rate and plateaued productivity. Tangential flow 
      ultrafiltration was used to concentrate cell-free enzyme extracts 5-6-fold, 
      reaching enzyme activity levels (1020-202 U L(-1)) that could allow their direct 
      application.

AB  - α-amylases are vital biocatalysts that constitute a billion-dollar industry with 
      a substantial and enduring global demand. Amylases hydrolyze the α-1,4-glycosidic 
      linkages in starch polymers to generate maltose and malto-oligosaccharides 
      subunits. Amylases are key enzymes that have promising applications in various 
      industrial processes ranging from pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, textile food 
      industries to bioremediation and biofuel sectors. Microbial enzymes have been 
      widely used in industrial applications owing to their ease of availability, 
      cost-effectiveness and better stability at extreme temperatures and pH. 
      α-amylases derived from distinct microbial origins exhibit diverse 
      characteristics, which make them suitable for specific applications. The routine 
      application of immobilized enzymes has become a standard practice in the 
      production of numerous industrial products across the pharmaceutical, chemical, 
      and food industries. This review details the structural makeup of microbial 
      α-amylase to understand its thermodynamic characteristics, aiming to identify key 
      areas that could be targeted for improving the thermostability, pH tolerance and 
      catalytic activity of α-amylase through various immobilization techniques or 
      specific enzyme engineering methods. Additionally, the review briefly explores 
      the enzyme production strategies, potential sources of α-amylases, and use of 
      cost-effective and sustainable raw materials for enzyme production to obtain 
      α-amylases with unconventional applications in various industrial sectors. Major 
      hurdles, challenges and future prospects involving microbial α-amylases has been 
      briefly discussed by considering its diverse applications in industrial 
      bioprocessing.

AB  - The Bacillaceae family members are a good source of bacteria for bioprocessing 
      and biotransformation involving whole cells or enzymes. In contrast to Bacillus 
      and Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus is a relatively new genus that was proposed in the 
      year 2000. Because these bacteria are alkali-tolerant thermophiles, they are 
      suitable for many industrial applications. More than a decade after the first 
      report of Anoxybacillus, knowledge accumulated from fundamental and applied 
      studies suggests that this genus can serve as a good alternative in many 
      applications related to starch and lignocellulosic biomasses, environmental waste 
      treatment, enzyme technology, and possibly bioenergy production. This current 
      review provides the first summary of past and recent discoveries regarding the 
      isolation of Anoxybacillus, its medium requirements, its proteins that have been 
      characterized and cloned, bioremediation applications, metabolic studies, and 
      genomic analysis. Comparisons to some other members of Bacillaceae and possible 
      future applications of Anoxybacillus are also discussed.

AB  - Main hurdles of lignin valorization are its diverse chemical composition, 
      recalcitrance, and poor solubility due to high-molecular weight and branched 
      structure. Controlled fragmentation of lignin could lead to its use in higher 
      value products such as binders, coatings, fillers, etc. Oxidative enzymes (i.e., 
      laccases and peroxidases) have long been proposed as a potentially promising tool 
      in lignin depolymerization. However, their application was limited to ambient pH, 
      where lignin is poorly soluble in water. A Finnish biotechnology company, MetGen 
      Oy, that designs and supplies industrial enzymes, has developed and brought to 
      market several lignin oxidizing enzymes, including an extremely alkaline lignin 
      oxidase MetZyme(®) LIGNO™, a genetically engineered laccase of bacterial origin. 
      This enzyme can function at pH values as high as 10-11 and at elevated 
      temperatures, addressing lignin at its soluble state. In this article, main 
      characteristics of this enzyme as well as its action on bulk lignin coming from 
      an industrial process are demonstrated. Lignin modification by MetZyme(®) LIGNO™ 
      was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and dynamic 
      light scattering for monitoring particle size of solubilized lignin. Under highly 
      alkaline conditions, laccase treatment not only decreased molecular weight of 
      lignin but also increased its solubility in water and altered its dispersion 
      properties. Importantly, organic solvent-free soluble lignin fragmentation 
      allowed for robust industrially relevant membrane separation technologies to be 
      applicable for product fractionation. These enzyme-based solutions open new 
      opportunities for biorefinery lignin valorization thus paving the way for 
      economically viable biorefinery business.

TI  - Valorization of Palm Oil Industrial Waste as Feedstock for Lipase Production.
PG  - 558-71
LID - 10.1007/s12010-016-2013-z [doi]
AB  - The use of residues from the industrial processing of palm oil as carbon source 
      and inducer for microbial lipase production can be a way to add value to such 
      residues and to contribute to reduced enzyme costs. The aim of this work was to 
      investigate the feasibility of using palm oil industrial waste as feedstock for 
      lipase production in different cultivation systems. Evaluation was made of lipase 
      production by a selected strain of Aspergillus niger cultivated under solid-state 
      (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF). Lipase activity levels up to 15.41 IU/mL 
      were achieved under SSF. The effects of pH and temperature on the lipase activity 
      of the SSF extract were evaluated using statistical design methodology, and 
      maximum activities were obtained between pH 4.0 and 6.5 and at temperatures 
      between 37 and 55 °C. This lipase presented good thermal stability up to 60 °C 
      and higher specificity towards long carbon chain substrates. The results 
      demonstrate the potential application of palm oil industrial residues for lipase 
      production and contribute to the technological advances needed to develop 
      processes for industrial enzymes production.

AB  - Onion skins, actually recycled as organic fertilizers, could be used as a 
      substrate in environmental-friendly bioprocesses to recover high-value bioactive 
      compounds and food ingredients.In this work, a bioprospecting method was carried 
      out including 94 bacterial and 45 yeast strains from several agri-food and 
      environmental niches to verify their ability to grow on onion skins as unique 
      nutrients source.Red and yellow onion skins were assessed by newly selected 
      starter-driven liquid submerged fermentation assays mainly aimed at the release 
      and modification of polyphenols through microbial activities. Fermented onion 
      skins were also investigated as a inexpensive favourable source of microbial 
      enzymes (amylases, proteases, lipases, esterases, cellulases, xylanases).In red 
      onion skins, the treatment with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TB 11-32 produced a 
      slight increase of bioactive compounds in terms of total phenolics, whereas with 
      the yeast strain Zygosaccharomyces mrakii CL 30 - 29 the quercetin aglycone 
      content increased of about 25% of the initial raw material.In yellow onion skins 
      inoculated, the highest content of phenolic compounds was detected with the yeast 
      strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae En SC, while quercetin aglycone increased of 
      about 60% of the initial raw material in presence of the bacterial strain L. 
      plantarum C 180 - 34.In conclusion, the proposed microbial pre-treatment method 
      can be a potential strategy to re-use onion skins as a fermentation substrate, 
      and as a first step in the development of a biorefinery process to produce 
      value-added products from onion by-products.

PG  - 526-9
AB  - The importance and development of industrial biotechnology processing has led to 
      the utilisation of microbial enzymes in various applications. One of the 
      important enzymes is amylase, which hydrolyses starch to glucose. In Malaysia, 
      the use of sago starch has been increasing, and it is presently being used for 
      the production of glucose. Sago starch represents an alternative cheap carbon 
      source for fermentation processes that is attractive out of both economic and 
      geographical considerations. Production of fermentable sugars from the hydrolysis 
      of starches is normally carried out by an enzymatic processes that involves two 
      reaction steps, liquefaction and saccharification, each of which has different 
      temperature and pH optima with respect to the maximum reaction rate. This method 
      of starch hydrolysis requires the use of an expensive temperature control system 
      and a complex mixing device. Our laboratory has investigated the possibility of 
      using amylolytic enzyme-producing microorganisms in the continuous single-step 
      biological hydrolysis of sago flour for the production of a generic fermentation 
      medium. The ability of a novel DNA-recombinated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      strain YKU 107 (expressing alpha-amylase production) to hydrolyse gelatinised 
      sago starch production has been studied with the aim of further utilizing sago 
      starch to obtain value-added products.

AB  - Discovering sugar metabolism genes is of great interest for lignocellulosic 
      biorefinery. Xylose isomerases (XIs) were commonly screened from metagenomes 
      derived from bovine rumen, soil, and other sources. However, so far, XIs and 
      other sugar-utilizing enzymes have not been discovered from fecal metagenomes. In 
      this study, environmental DNA from the fecal samples collected from yellow cattle 
      (Bos taurus) was sequenced and analyzed. In the whole 14.26 Gbp clean data, 92 
      putative XIs were annotated. After sequence analysis, seven putative XIs were 
      heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized in vitro. The XIs 
      58444 and 58960 purified from E. coli exhibited 22% higher enzyme activity when 
      compared with that of the native E. coli XI. The XI 58444, similar to the XI from 
      Lachnospira multipara, exhibited a relatively stable activity profile across 
      different pH conditions. Four XIs were further investigated in budding yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae after codon optimization. Overexpression of the 
      codon-optimized 58444 enabled S. cerevisiae to utilize 6.4 g/L xylose after 96 h 
      without any other genetic manipulations, which is 56% higher than the control 
      yeast strain overexpressing an optimized XI gene xylA*3 selected by three rounds 
      of mutation. Our results provide evidence that a bovine fecal metagenome is a 
      novel and valuable source of XIs and other industrial enzymes for biotechnology 
      applications.

AB  - The fungal kingdom is the source of almost all industrial enzymes in use for 
      lignocellulose bioprocessing. We developed a systems-level approach that 
      integrates transcriptomic sequencing, proteomics, phenotype, and biochemical 
      studies of relatively unexplored basal fungi. Anaerobic gut fungi isolated from 
      herbivores produce a large array of biomass-degrading enzymes that 
      synergistically degrade crude, untreated plant biomass and are competitive with 
      optimized commercial preparations from Aspergillus and Trichoderma. Compared to 
      these model platforms, gut fungal enzymes are unbiased in substrate preference 
      due to a wealth of xylan-degrading enzymes. These enzymes are universally 
      catabolite-repressed and are further regulated by a rich landscape of noncoding 
      regulatory RNAs. Additionally, we identified several promising sequence-divergent 
      enzyme candidates for lignocellulosic bioprocessing.

AB  - Understanding enzymatic breakdown of plant biomass is crucial to develop 
      nature-inspired biotechnological processes. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases 
      (LPMOs) are microbial enzymes secreted by fungal saprotrophs involved in carbon 
      recycling. LPMOs modify biomass by oxidatively cleaving polysaccharides, thereby 
      enhancing the efficiency of glycoside hydrolases. Fungal AA9 LPMOs are active on 
      cellulose, but some members also display activity on hemicelluloses and/or 
      oligosaccharides. Although the active site subsites are well defined for a few 
      model LPMOs, the molecular determinants driving broad substrate specificity are 
      still not easily predictable. Based on bioinformatic clustering and sequence 
      alignments, we selected seven fungal AA9 LPMOs that differ in the amino-acid 
      residues constituting their subsites. Investigation of their substrate 
      specificities revealed that all these LPMOs are active on cellulose and 
      cello-oligosaccharides, as well as plant cell wall-derived hemicellulosic 
      polysaccharides, and carry out C4 oxidative cleavage. The product profiles from 
      cello-oligosaccharide degradation suggest that the subtle differences in 
      amino-acid sequence within the substrate-binding loop regions lead to different 
      preferred binding modes. Our functional analyses allowed us to probe the 
      molecular determinants of substrate binding within two AA9 LPMO subclusters. Many 
      wood-degrading fungal species rich in AA9 genes have at least one AA9 enzyme with 
      structural loop features that allow recognition of short β-(1,4)-linked glucan 
      chains. Time-course monitoring of these AA9 LPMOs on cello-oligosaccharides also 
      provides a useful model system for mechanistic studies of LPMO catalysis. These 
      results are valuable for the understanding of LPMO contribution to wood decaying 
      process in nature and for the development of sustainable biorefineries.

AB  - Enzymes are crucial for various technological applications, but their inherent 
      instability and short lifespan pose challenges. This study presents facile 
      immobilized enzyme technology with the development of thermoresponsive 
      enzyme-polymer conjugates (EPCs), using glucose oxidase (GOx) as a model enzyme, 
      to address these limitations. By conjugating heteropolymers to the glycan 
      moieties of GOx through a precise in situ polymerization process, we could 
      modulate the lower critical solution temperature of the EPCs, enhancing enzyme 
      performance without compromising its active site. The EPCs demonstrate a 
      switchable behavior that facilitates efficient homogeneous catalysis and easy 
      heterogeneous separation, reducing costs and environmental impact in industrial 
      applications. Our strategy presents a versatile platform for creating efficient 
      biocatalysts with tunable properties, marking a step forward in sustainable and 
      cost-effective bioprocessing.

AB  - The conversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass into fuels, chemicals, and 
      high-value materials using the biochemical platform has been considered the most 
      sustainable alternative for the implementation of future biorefineries. However, 
      the high cost of the cellulolytic enzymatic cocktails used in the 
      saccharification step significantly affects the economics of industrial 
      large-scale conversion processes. The on-site production of enzymes, integrated 
      to the biorefinery plant, is being considered as a potential strategy that could 
      be used to reduce costs. In such approach, the microbial production of enzymes 
      can be carried out using the same lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for fungal 
      development and biofuels production. Most of the microbial cultivation processes 
      for the production of industrial enzymes have been developed using the 
      conventional submerged fermentation. Recently, a sequential solid-state followed 
      by submerged fermentation has been described as a potential alternative 
      cultivation method for cellulolytic enzymes production. This chapter presents the 
      detailed procedure of the sequential cultivation method, which could be employed 
      for the on-site production of the cellulolytic enzymes required to convert 
      lignocellulosic biomass into simple sugars.

TI  - Identification and characterization of lignin depolymerization enzymes in

AB  - Biological pretreatment using microbial enzymes appears to be the most promising 
      pre-treatment technology for the breakdown of recalcitrant lignin structure. This 
      research focuses on the identification and characterization of 
      lignin-depolymerizing enzymes in Bacillus subtilis strain S11Y, previously 
      isolated from palm oil wastes in Malaysia. The draft genome sequences of this 
      highly lignin-depolymerizing strain revealed that the genome lacked any of the 
      well-known dye-decolorizing peroxidase or catalase-peroxidase that are commonly 
      reported to be involved in lignin depolymerization by bacteria, indicating that 
      strain S11Y has distinct sets of potential lignin depolymerization genes. The 
      oxidative stress-related enzymes Cu/Zn type-superoxide dismutase (Sod2) and a 
      heme-containing monofunctional catalase (Kat2) were identified in the genome 
      sequences that are of interest. Their lignin-depolymerizing ability were 
      evaluated by treating Alkali lignin (AL) with each enzyme and their degradation 
      ability were evaluated using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), 
      ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS), and gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which successfully proved lignin 
      depolymerizing ability. Successful evaluation of lignin depolymerizing enzymes 
      can be applicable for lignin pretreatment process in green energy production and 
      generation of valuable chemicals in bio-refinery.

AB  - Enzymatic depolymerization of recalcitrant polysaccharides plays a key role in 
      accessing the renewable energy stored within lignocellulosic biomass, and natural 
      biodiversities may be explored to discover microbial enzymes that have evolved to 
      conquer this task in various environments. Here, a metagenome from a thermophilic 
      microbial community was mined to yield a novel, thermostable cellulase, named 
      mgCel6A, with activity on an industrial cellulosic substrate (sulfite-pulped 
      Norway spruce) and a glucomannanase side activity. The enzyme consists of a 
      glycoside hydrolase family 6 catalytic domain (GH6) and a family 2 carbohydrate 
      binding module (CBM2) that are connected by a linker rich in prolines and 
      threonines. MgCel6A exhibited maximum activity at 85°C and pH 5.0 on 
      carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), but in prolonged incubations with the industrial 
      substrate, the highest yields were obtained at 60°C, pH 6.0. Differential 
      scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated a Tm(app) of 76°C. Both functional data and 
      the crystal structure, solved at 1.88 Å resolution, indicate that mgCel6A is an 
      endoglucanase. Comparative studies with a truncated variant of the enzyme showed 
      that the CBM increases substrate binding, while not affecting thermal stability. 
      Importantly, at higher substrate concentrations the full-length enzyme was 
      outperformed by the catalytic domain alone, underpinning previous suggestions 
      that CBMs may be less useful in high-consistency bioprocessing.

AB  - Aspergillus sp. plays an essential role in lignocellulosic biomass recycling and 
      is also exploited as cell factories for the production of industrial enzymes. 
      This study profiled the secretome of Aspergillus fumigatus when grown with 
      cellulose, xylan and starch by high throughput quantitative proteomics using 
      isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Post 
      translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play a critical role in protein 
      functions. However, our understanding of the PTMs in secretory proteins is 
      limited. Here, we present the identification of PTMs such as deamidation of 
      secreted proteins of A. fumigatus. This study quantified diverse groups of 
      extracellular secreted enzymes and their functional classification revealed 
      cellulases and glycoside hydrolases (32.9%), amylases (0.9%), hemicellulases 
      (16.2%), lignin degrading enzymes (8.1%), peptidases and proteases (11.7%), 
      chitinases, lipases and phosphatases (7.6%), and proteins with unknown function 
      (22.5%). The comparison of quantitative iTRAQ results revealed that cellulose and 
      xylan stimulates expression of specific cellulases and hemicellulases, and their 
      abundance level as a function of substrate. In-depth data analysis revealed 
      deamidation as a major PTM of key cellulose hydrolyzing enzymes like 
      endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and glucosidases. Hemicellulose degrading 
      endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, monosidases, xylosidases, lignin degrading laccase, 
      isoamyl alcohol oxidase and oxidoreductases were also found to be deamidated. 
      BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The filamentous fungi play an essential role in 
      lignocellulosic biomass recycling and fungal strains belonging to Aspergillus 
      were also exploited as cell factories for the production of organic acids, 
      pharmaceuticals, and industrially important enzymes. In this study, extracellular 
      proteins secreted by thermophilic A. fumigatus when grown with cellulose, xylan 
      and starch were profiled using isobaric tags for relative and absolute 
      quantification (iTRAQ) by adopting liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry. The comparison of quantitative iTRAQ results revealed that 
      cellulose and xylan stimulate expression of specific cellulases and 
      hemicellulases, and expression level as a function of substrate. Post 
      translational modifications revealed deamidation of key cellulases including 
      endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and glucosidases; and hemicellulases and 
      lignin degrading enzymes. The knowledge on deamidated enzymes along with specific 
      sites of modifications could be crucial information for further functional 
      studies of these enzymes of A. fumigatus.

TI  - Bioprocessing of some agro-industrial residues for endoglucanase production by 
      the new subsp.; Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus strain NEAE-J.
PG  - 743-56
AB  - The use of low cost agro-industrial residues for the production of industrial 
      enzymes is one of the ways to reduce significantly production costs. Cellulase 
      producing actinomycetes were isolated from soil and decayed agricultural wastes. 
      Among them, a potential culture, strain NEAE-J, was selected and identified on 
      the basis of morphological, cultural, physiological and chemotaxonomic 
      properties, together with 16S rDNA sequence. It is proposed that strain NEAE-J 
      should be included in the species Streptomyces albogriseolus as a representative 
      of a novel sub-species, Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus strain 
      NEAE-J and sequencing product was deposited in the GenBank database under 
      accession number JN229412. This organism was tested for its ability to produce 
      endoglucanase and release reducing sugars from agro-industrial residues as 
      substrates. Sugarcane bagasse was the most suitable substrate for endoglucanase 
      production. Effects of process variables, namely incubation time, temperature, 
      initial pH and nitrogen source on production of endoglucanase by submerged 
      fermentation using Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus have been 
      studied. Accordingly optimum conditions have been determined. Incubation 
      temperature of 30 °C after 6 days, pH of 6.5, 1% sugarcane bagasse as carbon 
      source and peptone as nitrogen source were found to be the optimum for 
      endoglucanase production. Optimization of the process parameters resulted in 
      about 2.6 fold increase in the endoglucanase activity. Therefore, Streptomyces 
      albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus coud be potential microorganism for the 
      intended application.

TI  - Process of fruit peel waste biorefinery: a case study of citrus waste 
      biorefinery, its environmental impacts and recommendations.

AB  - Fruit peels are a rich source of cellulose, hemicellulose, phenolic compounds, 
      and terpenic compounds. Thus, they have the potential to be a novel renewable, 
      sustainable, and low-cost raw material (source) for the production of several 
      value-added products based on framework and concepts such as waste hierarchy that 
      includes biofertilizers, dietary fiber, animal feed, industrial enzymes, 
      substrate for the bioactive compounds production, synthesis of nanomaterials, and 
      clean energy (from residual biomass). With a view of evaluating the environmental 
      burden of biorefinery, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for a 
      representative citrus waste (CW) biorefinery. The functional unit used for LCA 
      was set as 2500 kg of CW processed. The overall GWP was observed to be 937.3 kg 
      CO(2) equivalent per 2500 kg of CW processed. On further analysis of the 
      environmental impact, it was found that different steps contributed 
      significantly, as shown by the various environmental indicator values. 
      Alternative advanced process intensification technologies like microwave and 
      ultrasound-assisted steps replacing the conventional steps when implemented show 
      considerable reduction in environmental indicator values. The variations in the 
      contribution to environmental indicators should be considered during the design 
      and process selection of biorefineries.

AB  - Transforming global agricultural waste into eco-friendly products like industrial 
      enzymes through bioconversion can help address sustainability challenges aligning 
      with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Present study explored 
      the production of high-yield food-grade cellulolytic enzymes from Trichoderma 
      reesei MTCC 4876, using a novel media formulation with a combination of waste 
      sorghum grass and cottonseed oil cake (3:1). Optimization of physical and 
      environmental parameters, along with the screening and optimization of media 
      components, led to an upscaled process in a novel 6-L solid-state fermentation 
      (SSF)-packed bed reactor (PBR) with a substrate loading of 200 g. Saturated 
      forced aeration proved crucial, resulting in high fungal biomass (31.15 ± 0.63 mg 
      glucosamine/gm dry fermented substrate) and high yield cellulase (20.64 ± 0.36 
      FPU/g-ds) and xylanase (16,186 ± 912 IU/g-ds) production at an optimal airflow 
      rate of 0.75 LPM. The PBR exhibited higher productivity than shake flasks for all 
      the enzyme systems. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration of the crude cellulolytic 
      extract achieved 94% and 71% recovery, respectively, with 13.54 FPU/mL activity 
      in the cellulolytic enzyme concentrate. The concentrate displayed stability 
      across wide pH and temperature ranges, with a half-life of 24.5-h at 50 °C. The 
      cellulase concentrate, validated for food-grade safety, complies with permissible 
      limits for potential pathogens, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and pesticide residue. 
      It significantly improved apple juice clarity (94.37 T%) by reducing turbidity 
      (21%) and viscosity (99%) while increasing total reducing sugar release by 63% 
      compared with untreated juice. The study also highlighted the potential use of 
      lignin-rich fermented end residue for fuel pellets within permissible SOx 
      emission limits, offering sustainable biorefinery prospects. Utilizing agro 
      wastes in a controlled bioreactor environment underscores the potential for 
      efficient large-scale cellulase production, enabling integration into food-grade 
      applications and presenting economic benefits to fruit juice industries.

TI  - Carbon, food and fuel security - will biotechnology solve this irreconcilable 
      trinity?
PG  - 115-34
AB  - The emergence of food security as a key policy issue in developed nations has 
      been concomitant with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the 
      implementation of Environmental Management Systems in primary industries. 
      Biotechnological interventions such as biorefinery platforms that produce 
      chemicals and fuels provide opportunities to reconcile the security and 
      environmental sustainability criteria increasingly sought after by governments. 
      Indeed, sustainable and more carbon neutral options have been positively 
      benchmarked against scenarios based solely on petrochemical feedstocks. Notably, 
      biotechnology companies are beginning to use Environmental Management Systems 
      employed by other industries to advocate the benefits of green technologies that 
      employ GM, industrial enzymes and bio-materials. Management systems such as Life 
      Cycle Analysis are providing a powerful means to measure benefits and augment 
      change in the biotechnology sector. These methods are discussed here in the 
      context of the emergent 21st Century debates on security. The evidence presented 
      leads to a conclusion where biotechnologies are likely to offer increasingly high 
      impact options for sustainability and security criteria required for food and 
      fuel supply.

TI  - Transient Silencing of DNA Repair Genes Improves Targeted Gene Integration in the 
      Filamentous Fungus Trichoderma reesei.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00535-17 [doi]
LID - e00535-17
AB  - Trichoderma reesei is a filamentous fungus that is used worldwide to produce 
      industrial enzymes. Industrial strains have traditionally been created though 
      systematic strain improvement using mutagenesis and screening approaches. It is 
      also desirable to specifically manipulate the genes of the organism to further 
      improve and to modify the strain. Targeted integration in filamentous fungi is 
      typically hampered by very low frequencies of homologous recombination. To 
      address this limitation, we have developed a simple transient method for 
      silencing genes in T. reesei Using gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 
      targeted to mus53, we could achieve up to 90% knockdown of mus53 mRNA. As a 
      practical example, we demonstrated that transient silencing of DNA repair genes 
      significantly improved homologous integration of DNA at a specific locus in a 
      standard protoplast transformation. The best transient silencing of mus53 with 
      siRNAs in protoplasts could achieve up to 59% marker gene integration.IMPORTANCE 
      The previous solution for improving targeted integration efficiency has been 
      deleting nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair genes. However, deleting 
      these important repair genes may lead to unintended consequences for genomic 
      stability and could lead to the accumulation of spontaneous mutations. Our method 
      of transiently silencing NHEJ repair pathway genes allows recovery of their 
      important repair functions. Here we report a silencing approach for improving 
      targeted DNA integration in filamentous fungi. Furthermore, our transient 
      silencing method is a truly flexible approach that is capable of knocking down 
      the expression of a target gene in growing mycelial cultures, which could 
      facilitate the broad study of gene functions in T. reesei.

TI  - Synergistic Action of a Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase and a 
      Cellobiohydrolase from Penicillium funiculosum in Cellulose Saccharification 
      under High-Level Substrate Loading.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01769-20 [doi]
LID - e01769-20
AB  - Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are crucial industrial enzymes 
      required in the biorefinery industry as well as in the natural carbon cycle. 
      These enzymes, known to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds, are 
      produced by numerous bacterial and fungal species to assist in the degradation of 
      cellulosic biomass. In this study, we annotated and performed structural analysis 
      of an uncharacterized LPMO from Penicillium funiculosum (PfLPMO9) based on 
      computational methods in an attempt to understand the behavior of this enzyme in 
      biomass degradation. PfLPMO9 exhibited 75% and 36% sequence identities with LPMOs 
      from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) and Lentinus similis (LsLPMO9A), 
      respectively. Furthermore, multiple fungal genetic manipulation tools were 
      employed to simultaneously overexpress LPMO and cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) in a 
      catabolite-derepressed strain of Penicillium funiculosum, PfMig1(88) (an 
      engineered variant of P. funiculosum), to improve its saccharification 
      performance toward acid-pretreated wheat straw (PWS) at 20% substrate loading. 
      The resulting transformants showed improved LPMO and CBH1 expression at both the 
      transcriptional and translational levels, with ∼200% and ∼66% increases in 
      ascorbate-induced LPMO and Avicelase activities, respectively. While the 
      secretome of PfMig(88) overexpressing LPMO or CBH1 increased the saccharification 
      of PWS by 6% or 13%, respectively, over the secretome of PfMig1(88) at the same 
      protein concentration, the simultaneous overexpression of these two genes led to 
      a 20% increase in saccharification efficiency over that observed with PfMig1(88), 
      which accounted for 82% saccharification of PWS under 20% substrate 
      loading.IMPORTANCE The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass by cellulases 
      continues to be a significant bottleneck in the development of second-generation 
      biobased industries. While increasing efforts are being made to obtain indigenous 
      cellulases for biomass hydrolysis, the high production cost of this enzyme 
      remains a crucial challenge affecting its wide availability for the efficient 
      utilization of cellulosic materials. This is because it is challenging to obtain 
      an enzymatic cocktail with balanced activity from a single host. This report 
      describes the annotation and structural analysis of an uncharacterized lytic 
      polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) gene in Penicillium funiculosum and its 
      impact on biomass deconstruction upon overexpression in a catabolite-derepressed 
      strain of P. funiculosum Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1), which is the most important 
      enzyme produced by many cellulolytic fungi for the saccharification of 
      crystalline cellulose, was further overexpressed simultaneously with LPMO. The 
      resulting secretome was analyzed for enhanced LPMO and exocellulase activities 
      and the corresponding improvement in saccharification performance (by ∼20%) under 
      high-level substrate loading using a minimal amount of protein.

TI  - Valorization of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) fruit processing by-products and 
      wastes using bioprocess technology - Review.
PG  - 105-20
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.12.004 [doi]
AB  - The date palm Phoenix dactylifera has played an important role in the day-to-day 
      life of the people for the last 7000 years. Today worldwide production, 
      utilization and industrialization of dates are continuously increasing since date 
      fruits have earned great importance in human nutrition owing to their rich 
      content of essential nutrients. Tons of date palm fruit wastes are discarded 
      daily by the date processing industries leading to environmental problems. Wastes 
      such as date pits represent an average of 10% of the date fruits. Thus, there is 
      an urgent need to find suitable applications for this waste. In spite of several 
      studies on date palm cultivation, their utilization and scope for utilizing date 
      fruit in therapeutic applications, very few reviews are available and they are 
      limited to the chemistry and pharmacology of the date fruits and phytochemical 
      composition, nutritional significance and potential health benefits of date fruit 
      consumption. In this context, in the present review the prospects of valorization 
      of these date fruit processing by-products and wastes' employing fermentation and 
      enzyme processing technologies towards total utilization of this valuable 
      commodity for the production of biofuels, biopolymers, biosurfactants, organic 
      acids, antibiotics, industrial enzymes and other possible industrial chemicals 
      are discussed.

TI  - Unlocking Green Biomanufacturing Potential: Superior Heterologous Gene Expression 
      with a T7 Integration Overexpression System in Bacillus subtilis.
PG  - 1977-1987
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.4c00694 [doi]
AB  - Industrial biotechnology employs cells for producing valuable products and 
      serving as biocatalysts sustainably, addressing resource, energy, and 
      environmental issues. Bacillus subtilis is a preferred host for creating 
      microbial chassis cells and producing industrial enzymes and functional 
      nutritional products. In this study, a dual-module T7 integration expression 
      system in B. subtilis was established. The first module, driven by the T7 RNA 
      polymerase, was integrated into the genome via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Another 
      module responsible for expression control was systematically integrated into 28 
      discrete chromosomal loci and the impact of different genomic positions on gene 
      expression was explored, resulting in a high-intensity integrated expression 
      system. Furthermore, by modifying the LacI repressor factor for biological 
      regulation, we achieved a strong expression intensity without the inducer 
      addition. This system was successfully used to express phospholipase D and 
      hyaluronic acid lyase, resulting in extracellular enzyme activities of 339.12 
      U/mL and 2.60 × 10(4) U/mL, respectively. Additionally, by exclusively targeting 
      the HA gene cluster for expression, a production yield of 6.86 g/L was achieved 
      on a 5 L fermentation scale. The system eliminates the use of antibiotics and 
      inducers, offering a controllable, efficient, and promising gene expression 
      regulation tool in B. subtilis, enhancing its potential for biomanufacturing 
      applications.

TI  - Valorization of chicken feather waste using recombinant bacillus subtilis cells 
      by solid-state fermentation for soluble proteins and serine alkaline protease 
      production.

AB  - Feather waste, a by-product of the poultry industry, is rich in proteins, 
      peptides, and amino acids. Improper disposal of feathers can cause environmental 
      pollution. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is a viable alternative to submerged 
      fermentation due to its simplicity, productivity, and lower cost. The study goal 
      is a biorefinery of chicken feather waste supplemented with wheat bran using a 
      recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain to produce soluble proteins and a serine 
      alkaline protease. Plackett-Burman Design and Central Composite Design were 
      utilized in a statistical-mathematical model to optimize the process. 
      Multi-factorial design optimization resulted in 80 % substrate degradation 
      efficiency, an alkaline protease with dual activities (1423 proteolytic units and 
      190 keratinolytic units), 214 mg soluble proteins/g substrate, and 87 % model 
      validation. Scaling up the SSF process to 50 g of substrate significantly 
      enhanced the end products of feather biodegradation to 1616 proteolytic units, 
      2844 keratinolytic units, and 127 mg soluble proteins/g substrate. AIM AND SCOPE 
      OF THE MANUSCRIPT: The aim of the present study is to utilize chicken feather 
      waste (alone or supplemented with other materials) through recombinant Bacillus 
      subtilis cells using solid state fermentation (SSF) at a laboratory scale. The 
      plan study provides a promising waste management in the environmental field 
      concerning biodegradation of such recalcitrant keratinous wastes supplemented 
      with agricultural residues via recombinant microorganism. On semi-pilot scale, 
      high production and quality of soluble protein, protease, and keratinase activity 
      were produced according to the statistically optimised first stage fermentation 
      in the laboratory scale. The bioconversion process took place as a major goal to 
      obtain valuable products, with low utilities and energy requirements. Therefore, 
      this will consider as an economically feasible and environmentally friendly 
      alternative. Moreover, this study is considered as first step fermentation for 
      feather waste to pave the road for directing it to a second step fermentation for 
      biogas production and bioenergy generation through bio-electrochemical systems 
      (Manuscript under publication).

      novel bacterial DyP-type peroxidase.
PG  - 913-927
LID - 10.1007/s10295-018-2064-y [doi]
AB  - Lignin valorization can be obtained through cleavage of selected bonds by 
      microbial enzymes, in which lignin is segregated from cellulose and hemicellulose 
      and abundant phenolic compounds can be provided. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. 
      Q18, previously isolated from rotten wood in China, was used to degrade alkali 
      lignin and raw lignocellulosic material. Gel-permeation chromatography, 
      field-emission scanning electron microscope, and GC-MS were combined to 
      investigate the degradation process. The GC-MS results revealed that the 
      quantities of aromatic compounds with phenol ring from lignin increased 
      significantly after incubation with Pseudomonas sp. Q18, which indicated the 
      degradation of lignin. According to the lignin-derived metabolite analysis, it 
      was proposed that a DyP-type peroxidase (PmDyP) might exist in strain Q18. 
      Thereafter, the gene of PmDyP was cloned and expressed, after which the 
      recombinant PmDyP was purified and the enzymatic kinetics of PmDyP were assayed. 
      According to results, PmDyP showed promising characteristics for lignocellulosic 
      biodegradation in biorefinery.

AB  - Microbial enzymes from extremophilic regions such as hot spring serve as an 
      important source of various stable and valuable industrial enzymes. The present 
      paper encompasses the modeling and optimization approach for production of 
      halophilic, solvent, tolerant, and alkaline lipase from Staphylococcus arlettae 
      through response surface methodology integrated nature inspired genetic 
      algorithm. Response surface model based on central composite design has been 
      developed by considering the individual and interaction effects of fermentation 
      conditions on lipase production through submerged fermentation. The validated 
      input space of response surface model (with R (2) value of 96.6%) has been 
      utilized for optimization through genetic algorithm. An optimum lipase yield of 
      6.5 U/mL has been obtained using binary coded genetic algorithm predicted 
      conditions of 9.39% inoculum with the oil concentration of 10.285% in 2.99 hrs 
      using pH of 7.32 at 38.8°C. This outcome could contribute to introducing this 
      extremophilic lipase (halophilic, solvent, and tolerant) to industrial 
      biotechnology sector and will be a probable choice for different food, detergent, 
      chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The present work also demonstrated the 
      feasibility of statistical design tools integration with computational tools for 
      optimization of fermentation conditions for maximum lipase production.

TI  - Evaluation of enzyme mixtures in releasing fermentable sugars from pre-pulping 
      extracts of mixed northeast hardwoods.

AB  - One near-term option to developing a forest product biorefinery is to derive 
      pre-pulping extract from incoming wood chips before the main pulping step. The 
      release of monomer sugars from a xylan-rich extract, creating a fermentable 
      substrate is a prerequisite for utilization of pre-pulping extract for production 
      of ethanol or other value-added products. This study examined the individual and 
      mixture efficiencies of two hemicellulolytic microbial enzymes and two xylanase 
      preparations in catalyzing degradation of green liquor (GL) and hot water (HW) 
      pre-pulping extracts. The effects of four commercial enzyme preparations were 
      determined by assessing yields of xylose + galactose + mannose (xmg) obtained 
      under different reaction conditions. Of the individual enzyme preparations 
      tested, a sample NS 50012 was superior to the other enzyme preparations in 
      releasing xmg under conditions optimized for separate hydrolysis and fermentation 
      and for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. In comparison to 
      pre-pulping extracts treated with HW, extract treated with GL was found to 
      inhibit the action of all tested enzymes. This inhibition may be related to 
      higher salt and lignin phenol in the GL extract. On both types of extracts, the 
      mixture constituted by NS 50012 and NS 50030 provided the highest yield of 
      hemicellulose conversion at 55 degrees C and pH 5.5. The generated digestibility 
      thus signified that the synergistic effectiveness in xylan + galactan + mannan 
      (XMG) hydrolysis between NS 50012 (from Aspergillus aculeatus) and NS 50030 (from 
      Aspergillus oryzae) is the result of an interaction mechanism involving different 
      XMG-degrading enzyme activities in the two enzyme preparations.

TI  - Improvement on D-xylose to Xylitol Biotransformation by Candida guilliermondii 
      Using Cells Permeabilized with Triton X-100 and Selected Process Conditions.
PG  - 969-979
AB  - Cells of Candida guilliermondii permeabilized with Triton X-100 were able to 
      efficiently produce xylitol from a medium composed only by D-xylose and 
      MgCl(2)·6H(2)O in potassium phosphate buffer, at 35 °C and pH 6.5. Under these 
      conditions, the results were similar to those obtained when cofactor and 
      co-substrate or nutrients were added to the medium (about 95 % D-xylose was 
      assimilated producing 42 g/L of xylitol, corresponding to 0.80 g/g yield and 
      2.65 g/L h volumetric productivity). Furthermore, the permeabilized cells kept 
      the D-xylose assimilation in about 90 % and the xylitol production in approx. 
      40 g/L during three bioconversion cycles of 16 h each. These values are highly 
      relevant when compared to others reported in the literature using enzyme 
      technology and fermentative process, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of 
      the proposed method. The present study reveals that the use of permeabilized 
      cells is an interesting alternative to obtain high xylitol productivity using low 
      cost medium formulation. This approach may allow the future development of 
      xylitol production from xylose present in lignocellulosic biomass, with 
      additional potential for implementation in biorefinery strategies.

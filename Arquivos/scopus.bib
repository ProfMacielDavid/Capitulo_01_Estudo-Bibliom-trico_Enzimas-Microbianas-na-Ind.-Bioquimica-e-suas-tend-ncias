	abstract = {The current expansion of seaweed farming to North America and Europe can be a cornerstone in a new “blue bioeconomy” in the Northern Hemisphere. In this domain, the focus of R&D efforts is on creating value-added products through new biorefining processes for valorizing the unique polysaccharides of seaweeds. Apart from direct consumption of seaweeds as food—particularly in the Asian cuisine—commercial seaweed products are primarily natural hydrocolloids used to make viscous suspensions and gels, but new valuable products exerting bioactivity are coming into focus. This recent development rests on targeted, gentle extraction and modification of the seaweed polysaccharides using tailormade bioprocessing enzyme technologies. Since brown seaweed cultivation is rising in the Northern Hemisphere, this article provides an overview of recent advances and prospects in brown seaweed biorefining.

	abstract = {Lignin is a substantial component of lignocellulosic biomass but is under-utilized relative to the cellulose and hemicellulose components. Historically, lignin has been burned as a source of process heat, but this heat is usually in excess of the process energy demands. Current models indicate that development of an economically competitive biorefinery system requires adding value to lignin beyond process heat. This addition of value, also known as lignin valorization, requires economically viable processes for separating the lignin from the other biomass components, depolymerizing the lignin into monomeric subunits, and then upgrading these monomers to a value-added product. The fact that lignin's biological role is to provide biomass with structural integrity means that this heteropolymer can be difficult to depolymerize. However, there are chemical and biological routes to upgrade lignin from its native form to compounds of industrial value. Here we review the historical background and current technology of (thermo) chemical depolymerization of lignin; the natural ability of microbial enzymes and pathways to utilize lignin, the current prospecting work to find novel microbial routes to lignin degradation, and some applications of these microbial enzymes and pathways; and the current chemical and biological technologies to upgrade lignin-derived monomers. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A wealth of fungal enzymes has been identified from nature, which continue to drive strain engineering and bioprocessing for a range of industries. However, while a number of clades have been investigated, the vast majority of the fungal kingdom remains unexplored for industrial applications. Here, we discuss selected classes of fungal enzymes that are currently in biotechnological use, and explore more basal, non-conventional fungi and their underexploited biomass-degrading mechanisms as promising agents in the transition towards a bio-based society. Of special interest are anaerobic fungi like the Neocallimastigomycota, which were recently found to harbor the largest diversity of biomass-degrading enzymes among the fungal kingdom. Enzymes sourced from these basal fungi have been used to metabolically engineer substrate utilization in yeast, and may offer new paths to lignin breakdown and tunneled biocatalysis. We also contrast classic enzymology approaches with emerging ‘omics’-based tools to decipher function within novel fungal isolates and identify new promising enzymes. Recent developments in genome editing are expected to accelerate discovery and metabolic engineering within these systems, yet are still limited by a lack of high-resolution genomes, gene regulatory regions, and even appropriate culture conditions. Finally, we present new opportunities to harness the biomass-degrading potential of undercharacterized fungi via heterologous expression and engineered microbial consortia. © 2017 International Metabolic Engineering Society},

	abstract = {A continuous increase in the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is causing serious threats to the environment and life on the earth, and CO2 is one of the major candidates. Reducing the excess CO2 by converting into industrial products could be beneficial for the environment and also boost up industrial growth. In particular, the conversion of CO2 into methanol is very beneficial as it is cheaper to produce from biomass, less inflammable, and advantageous to many industries. Application of various plants, algae, and microbial enzymes to recycle the CO2 and using these enzymes separately along with CO2-phillic materials and chemicals can be a sustainable solution to reduce the global carbon footprint. Materials such as MOFs, porphyrins, and nanomaterials are also used widely for CO2 absorption and conversion into methanol. Thus, a combination of enzymes and materials which convert the CO2 into methanol could energize the CO2 utilization. The CO2 to methanol conversion utilizes carbon better than the conventional syngas and the reaction yields fewer by-products. The methanol produced can further be utilized as a clean-burning fuel, in pharmaceuticals, automobiles and as a general solvent in various industries etc. This makes methanol an ideal fuel in comparison to the conventional petroleum-based ones and it is advantageous for a safer and cleaner environment. In this review article, various aspects of the circular economy with the present scenario of environmental crisis will also be considered for large-scale sustainable biorefinery of methanol production from atmospheric CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Global energy demands and global warming represent key challenges of the future of human society. Continous renewable energy supply is key for sustainable economy development. Waste plant biomass represent abundant source of renewable energy that can be transformed to biofuels and other value-added products, which is currently limited due to the lack of cost-effective biocatalysts. The bottleneck of this process is the degradation of structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls to soluble compounds that can be fermented to solvents or transformed to biogas via methanogenesis and can be used as biofuels or chemical raw materials. In order to replace traditional physical and chemical methods of lignocellulose pretreatment with more environmentally friendly biological approaches, native microbial enzyme systems are increasingly being explored as potential biocatalysts that could be used in these processes. Microbial enzymes are useful either as catalysts in the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses or as components incorporated in engineered microbes for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocelluloses. The unprecedented development of tools for genetic and metabolic engineering for a wide range of microorganisms enabled significant progress in the development of microbial cell factories optimized for the producton of biofuels. One of the most promising strategies aimed towards this goal, i.e. systematic design and heterologous expression of »designer cellulosomes« in industrial solventogenic strains is adressed in detail. © 2020 University of Ljubljana.

Many novel enzymes have been reported from all domains of life, such as plants, microbes, and animals. Nonetheless, industrially desirable enzymes of microbial origin are limited. This review article discusses the classifications, applications, sources, and challenges of most demanded industrial enzymes such as pectinases, cellulase, lipase, and protease. In addition, the production of novel enzymes through protein engineering technologies such as directed evolution, rational, and de novo design, for the improvement of existing industrial enzymes is also explored. We have also explored the role of metagenomics, nanotechnology, OMICs, and machine learning approaches in the bioprospecting of novel enzymes. Overall, this review covers the basics of biocatalysts in industrial and healthcare applications and provides an overview of existing microbial enzyme optimization tools. Key points: • Microbial bioactive molecules are vital for therapeutic and industrial applications. • High-throughput OMIC is the most proficient approach for novel enzyme discovery. • Comprehensive databases and efficient machine learning models are the need of the hour to fast forward de novo enzyme design and discovery. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The biomass to biofuels production process is green, sustainable, and an advanced technique to resolve the current environmental issues generated from fossil fuels. The production of biofuels from biomass is an enzyme mediated process, wherein β-glucosidase (BGL) enzymes play a key role in biomass hydrolysis by producing monomeric sugars from cellulose-based oligosaccharides. However, the production and availability of these enzymes realize their major role to increase the overall production cost of biomass to biofuels production technology. Therefore, the present review is focused on evaluating the production and efficiency of β-glucosidase enzymes in the bioconversion of cellulosic biomass for biofuel production at an industrial scale, providing its mechanism and classification. The application of BGL enzymes in the biomass conversion process has been discussed along with the recent developments and existing issues. Moreover, the production and development of microbial BGL enzymes have been explained in detail, along with the recent advancements made in the field. Finally, current hurdles and future suggestions have been provided for the future developments.

	abstract = {Current biorefinery approaches comprehend diverse biomass feedstocks and various conversion techniques to produce a variety of high-value biochemicals and biofuels. Lignocellulose is among the most abundant, bio-renewable, and sustainable bioresources on earth. It is regarded as a prodigious alternative raw feedstock to produce a large number of chemicals and biofuels. Producing biofuels and platform chemicals from lignocellulosic biomasses represent advantages in terms of energy and environmental perspectives. Lignocellulose is a main structural constituent of non-woody and woody plants consisting of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. Efficient exploitation of all these components is likely to play a considerable contribution to the economic viability of the processes since lignocellulosic biomass often necessitate pretreatment for liberating fermentable sugars and added value products that might serve as feedstocks for microbial strains to produce biofuels and biochemicals. Developing robust microbial culture and advancements in metabolic engineering approaches might lead to the rapid construction of cell factories for the effective biotechnological transformation of biomass feedstocks to produce biorefinery products. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the recent progress in the valorization of agro-industrial wastes as prospective microbial feedstocks to produce a spectrum of high-value products, such as microbial pigments, biopolymers, industrial biocatalysts, biofuels, biologically active compounds, bioplastics, biosurfactants, and biocontrol agents with therapeutic and industrial potentialities. Lignocellulosic biomass architecture, compositional aspects, revalorization, and pretreatment strategies are outlined for efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Moreover, metabolic engineering approaches are briefly highlighted to develop cell factories to make the lignocellulose biorefinery platforms appealing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Trichoderma reesei is a filamentous fungus that is used worldwide to produce industrial enzymes. Industrial strains have traditionally been created though systematic strain improvement using mutagenesis and screening approaches. It is also desirable to specifically manipulate the genes of the organism to further improve and to modify the strain. Targeted integration in filamentous fungi is typically hampered by very low frequencies of homologous recombination. To address this limitation, we have developed a simple transient method for silencing genes in T. reesei. Using gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to mus53, we could achieve up to 90% knockdown of mus53 mRNA. As a practical example, we demonstrated that transient silencing of DNA repair genes significantly improved homologous integration of DNA at a specific locus in a standard protoplast transformation. The best transient silencing of mus53 with siRNAs in protoplasts could achieve up to 59% marker gene integration. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Banana peel (BP) is an agrowaste produced in large volumes annually, especially by food-processing industries; however, its disposal is of significant concern. However, recent research suggests that BP is a valuable source of bioactive compounds, which can be converted into value-added products. This article reviews the conversion process of value-added products from BP and provides an outline on the chemical composition of BP and its possible applications. In addition, we also discuss the utilization of BP as a substrate to produce animal feed, biofertilizer, dietary fibers, clean energy, industrial enzymes, as well as its use in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Based on the research conducted so far, it is obvious that BP has a wide variety of applications, and thus, developing a biorefinery approach to adequately utilize BP will help realize its economic benefits to the fullest. Based on the valorization of BP, a scheme for BP biorefinery has been proposed. A material balance for BP biorefinery for 1-ton bone-dry BP is presented and our results show that 432 kg of protein or 170 kg of citric acid, 170 kg of pectin, 325 m3 of ethanol, and 220 m3 of methane can be produced. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Aims: Thermophilic proteases are important industrial enzymes because they can be used at high temperatures in various bioprocessing schemes. The bacterial population of the Cholistan desert was explored for thermophilic proteases and their industrial applications. Methodology and results: Three bacterial isolates K1, K5 and K7 were found promising protease producers. These isolates were preliminary identified as Bacillus based on morphological characteristics and biochemical tests (positive for catalase, oxidase and citrate tests, and negative for indole and urease tests). The isolates K1, K5 and K7 were further identified as Priestia endophytica, Lysinibacillus cresolivorans and Bacillus subtilis, respectively by phylogenetic analysis. The isolates grew best at 50 °C and P. endophytica (K1), L. cresolivorans (K5) and B. subtilis (K7) produced larger zones of hydrolysis at 37 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C at pH 7, respectively. The optimum temperature where protease activity was maximum was 65 °C for P. endophytica and L. cresolivorans and 55 °C for B. subtilis, and the optimum pH was 9. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The proteases produced by these isolates were found active at high temperatures (45 °C to 85 °C) and high pH (9-12), which make them industrially important thermoalkaliphilic proteases. These proteases successfully de-haired cow’s skin and de-stained blood from cotton cloth pieces, which are rarely tested applications of these proteases. © 2022.

	abstract = {Plastic has rapidly transformed our world, with many aspects of human life now relying on a variety of plastic materials. Biological plastic degradation, which employs microorganisms and their degradative enzymes, has emerged as one way to address the unforeseen consequences of the waste streams that have resulted from mass plastic production. The focus of this review is microbial hydrolase enzymes which have been found to act on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. The best characterized examples are discussed together with the use of genomic and protein engineering technologies to obtain PET hydrolase enzymes for different applications. In addition, the obstacles which are currently limiting the development of efficient PET bioprocessing are presented. By continuing to study the possible mechanisms and the structural elements of key enzymes involved in microbial PET hydrolysis, and by assessing the ability of PET hydrolase enzymes to work under practical conditions, this research will help inform large-scale waste management operations. Finally, the contribution of microbial PET hydrolases in creating a potential circular PET economy will be explored. This review combines the current knowledge on enzymatic PET processing with proposed strategies for optimization and use, to help clarify the next steps in addressing pollution by PET and other plastics. © Copyright © 2020 Carr, Clarke and Dobson.},

	abstract = {Enzymes are biological molecules that act as catalysts and speed up the biochemical reactions. The world’s biotechnological ventures are development of enzyme productiveness, and advancement of novel techniques for thriving their shelf existence. Nowadays, the most burning questions in enzyme technology are how to improve the enzyme productivity and reuse them. The immobilization of enzymes provides an excellent scope to reuse the enzymes several times to increase productivity. The main aim of the present study is the establishment of an immobilized multi-enzyme bio-system engineering process for the production of High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) with an industrial focus. In this study, multienzyme such as α-amylase, glucoamylase and glucose isomerase were immobilized in various support matrices like sodium alginate, sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, rice bran and combination of alginate with cellulosic materials. The activities of the immobilized multi-enzyme system for the production of HFCS from the starch solution were determined. The multienzyme immobilized in sodium alginate shows better fructose conversion than free enzyme. Among the support matrices, multi-enzyme immobilized in sawdust produced total 80.74 mg/mL of fructose from starch solution and it was able to be used in several production cycles. On the other hand, multi-enzyme immobilized in combination of sodium alginate and sawdust produced the maximum amount of fructose (total 84.82 mg/mL). The free enzyme produced 17.25 mg/mL of fructose from the starch solution in only a single cycle. In this study a new fixed bed immobilized multi-enzyme bioreactor system was developed for the production of HFCS directly from starch. This finding will create a new opportunity for the application of immobilized multi-enzyme systems in many sectors of industrial biotechnology. © 2024 Janee et al.

	abstract = {Biocatalysts, including live microbial cells/enzymes, have been considered a predominant and advantageous tool for effectively transforming biomass into biofuels and valued biochemicals. However, high production costs, separation, and reusability limit its practical application. Immobilization of single and multi-enzymes by employing different nano-supports have gained massive attention because of its elevated exterior domain and high enzymatic performance. Application of nanobiocatalyst can overcome the drawbacks mainly, stability and reusability, thus reflecting the importance of biomass-based biorefinery to make it profitable and sustainable. This review provides an in-depth, comprehensive analysis of nanobiocatalysts systems concerning nano supports and biocatalytic performance characteristics. Furthermore, the effects of nanobiocatalyst on waste biomass to biofuel and valued bioproducts in the biorefinery approach and their critical assessment are discussed. Lastly, this review elaborates commercialization and market outlooks of the bioconversion process using nanobiocatalyst, followed by different strategies to overcome the limitations and future research directions on nanobiocatalytic-based industrial bioprocesses. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cells of Candida guilliermondii permeabilized with Triton X-100 were able to efficiently produce xylitol from a medium composed only by d-xylose and MgCl2·6H2O in potassium phosphate buffer, at 35 °C and pH 6.5. Under these conditions, the results were similar to those obtained when cofactor and co-substrate or nutrients were added to the medium (about 95 % d-xylose was assimilated producing 42 g/L of xylitol, corresponding to 0.80 g/g yield and 2.65 g/L h volumetric productivity). Furthermore, the permeabilized cells kept the d-xylose assimilation in about 90 % and the xylitol production in approx. 40 g/L during three bioconversion cycles of 16 h each. These values are highly relevant when compared to others reported in the literature using enzyme technology and fermentative process, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The present study reveals that the use of permeabilized cells is an interesting alternative to obtain high xylitol productivity using low cost medium formulation. This approach may allow the future development of xylitol production from xylose present in lignocellulosic biomass, with additional potential for implementation in biorefinery strategies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Textile production is among the most pollutant industrial activity, consuming lake-sized volumes of fresh water, discharging hazardous chemicals, creating microplastic pollution from synthetic fibers, consuming unrenewable resources, and contributing more to climate change than international aviation and shipping combined. So, new technologies need to be applied throughout the textile production chain to minimize the environmental impact. The answer for the change can be in microorganisms. Microbial enzymes, powerful catalysts, can substitute chemicals during several processing steps, as well as, they can work in solid and water waste treatment. Microorganisms can produce biopigments that can confer color to fibers instead of synthetic dyes. The versatile metabolisms of microorganisms can be explored to produce new products from textile waste, like bioethanol, or produce new material as bacterial cellulose and recombinant silk. Even the entire microbial cell can be used as intelligent composites. This review aims to show how microorganisms offer several opportunities to improve the sustainability of the textile industry and expose the idea that microorganisms may support the future of the textile/fashion industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This review presents an update on the current knowledge of the secondary metabolite potential of the major fungal species used in industrial biotechnology, i.e., Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, and Trichoderma reesei. These species have a long history of safe use for enzyme production. Like most microorganisms that exist in a challenging environment in nature, these fungi can produce a large variety and number of secondary metabolites. Many of these compounds present several properties that make them attractive for different industrial and medical applications. A description of all known secondary metabolites produced by these species is presented here. Mycotoxins are a very limited group of secondary metabolites that can be produced by fungi and that pose health hazards in humans and other vertebrates when ingested in small amounts. Some mycotoxins are species-specific. Here, we present scientific basis for (1) the definition of mycotoxins including an update on their toxicity and (2) the clarity on misclassification of species and their mycotoxin potential reported in literature, e.g., A. oryzae has been wrongly reported as an aflatoxin producer, due to misclassification of Aspergillus flavus strains. It is therefore of paramount importance to accurately describe the mycotoxins that can potentially be produced by a fungal species that is to be used as a production organism and to ensure that production strains are not capable of producing mycotoxins during enzyme production. This review is intended as a reference paper for authorities, companies, and researchers dealing with secondary metabolite assessment, risk evaluation for food or feed enzyme production, or considerations on the use of these species as production hosts. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic agricultural waste has the potential to be converted into several value-added products such as biofuels, oligosaccharides, organic acids, and other chemicals. Among oligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are the major prebiotic compounds that can be produced from lignocellulosic waste through biocatalysis using microbial enzymes. XOS are highly regarded in the food and pharmaceutical sectors for their extensive health-boosting properties. Owing to the high demand for XOS, a lot of research is underway to develop technologies and bioprocesses for their sustainable and clean production. Conventional methods used for the production of XOS, such as autohydrolysis and chemical hydrolysis, are less sustainable and non-eco-friendly processes. Moreover, the quality of final product obtained using conventional methods is compromised. Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass using enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation to produce XOS is a favorable alternative to overcome this problem. This review highlights various factors that influence the sustainability and eco-friendly nature of the XOS production bioprocess. Optimizing the process parameters using different statistical tools may pave the way towards economical production of XOS with minimal use of resources. Moreover, the present review discusses about the lignocellulosic biorefinery that is involved in the conversion of agricultural wastes to several value-added products, which makes the bioprocess more economically sustainable. Collectively, modern technologies, including protein engineering, cell surface engineering, and metagenomics, are useful for the efficient bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to value-added products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, establishing an accurate evaluation method on cellulase enzyme cost is crucially important to support the health development of the future biorefinery industry. Currently, the cellulase cost evaluation methods were complicated and various controversial or even conflict results were presented. To give a reliable evaluation on this important topic, a rigorous analysis based on the Aspen Plus flowsheet simulation in the commercial scale ethanol plant was proposed in this study. The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) was used as the indicator to show the impacts of varying enzyme supply modes, enzyme prices, process parameters, as well as enzyme loading on the enzyme cost. The results reveal that the enzyme cost drives the cellulosic ethanol price below the minimum profit point when the enzyme is purchased from the current industrial enzyme market. An innovative production of cellulase enzyme such as on-site enzyme production should be explored and tested in the industrial scale to yield an economically sound enzyme supply for the future cellulosic ethanol production. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, studies on developing lignin-degrading microbial resources are still very few, which affects on establishing a consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic resource. The main aim of this work is to discover thermostable laccases for lignin thermo-biodegradation by metagenome-mining and biochemical characterization. Results indicate that 124 putative thermostable laccase genes were identified from generated metagenomes. Significantly, 3 rationally selected proteins showed actual activity and structural stability at temperatures up to 60 °C and pH values as low as 4.87. These active recombinant enzymes verify a practical advance in the functional prediction of target proteins, and simultaneous sequence-to-function relationships in this metagenome. In short, the identified thermostable laccase genes in this work could expand range of lignin biocatalysts and contribute to build an efficient lignin biorefinery. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The speed of sequencing of microbial genomes and metagenomes is providing an ever increasing resource for the identification of new robust biocatalysts with industrial applications for many different aspects of industrial biotechnology. Using ‘natures catalysts’ provides a sustainable approach to chemical synthesis of fine chemicals, general chemicals such as surfactants and new consumer-based materials such as biodegradable plastics. This provides a sustainable and ‘green chemistry’ route to chemical synthesis which generates no toxic waste and is environmentally friendly. In addition, enzymes can play important roles in other applications such as carbon dioxide capture, breakdown of food and other waste streams to provide a route to the concept of a ‘circular economy’ where nothing is wasted. The use of improved bioinformatic approaches and the development of new rapid enzyme activity screening methodology can provide an endless resource for new robust industrial biocatalysts.This mini-review will discuss several recent case studies where industrial enzymes of ‘high priority’ have been identified and characterised. It will highlight specific hydrolase enzymes and recent case studies which have been carried out within our group in Exeter. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The production of cellulosic sugars in lignocellulose biorefinery presents significant economic and environmental challenges due to the recalcitrant nature of biomass. The economic and facile production of renewable sugars with high yield and productivity is pivotal for the success of biorefinery. The cellulosic sugars are valorized either by biochemical routes or chemical routes or by hybrid (biological and chemical) routes into renewable chemicals, fuels, and materials. This manuscript focuses on the critical parameters affecting the economic viability of cellulosic sugar production at large scale, including biomass-specific pretreatment strategies and enzyme cost efficiency. High pretreatment costs, carbohydrate loss, and inhibitors production during pretreatment are identified as major contributors to overall production costs. To address these issues, we highlight the importance of developing cost-effective and efficient pretreatment methods tailored to specific biomass types and strategies for enzyme reuse and recycling. Future research should focus on innovations in pretreatment technologies, improved logistics for high-density feedstocks, biomass feeding systems, and advancements in enzyme technology to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of lignocellulosic biorefineries. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation and optimization to make the commercial-scale production of cellulosic sugars more viable and sustainable. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are crucial industrial enzymes required in the biorefinery industry as well as in the natural carbon cycle. These enzymes, known to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds, are produced by numerous bacterial and fungal species to assist in the degradation of cellulosic biomass. In this study, we annotated and performed structural analysis of an uncharacterized LPMO from Penicillium funiculosum (PfLPMO9) based on computational methods in an attempt to understand the behavior of this enzyme in biomass degradation. PfLPMO9 exhibited 75% and 36% sequence identities with LPMOs from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) and Lentinus similis (LsLPMO9A), respectively. Furthermore, multiple fungal genetic manipulation tools were employed to simultaneously overexpress LPMO and cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) in a catabolitederepressed strain of Penicillium funiculosum, PfMig188(an engineered variant of P. funiculosum), to improve its saccharification performance toward acid-pretreated wheat straw (PWS) at 20% substrate loading. The resulting transformants showed improved LPMO and CBH1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, with ~200% and ~66% increases in ascorbate-induced LPMO and Avicelase activities, respectively. While the secretome of PfMig88overexpressing LPMO or CBH1 increased the saccharification of PWS by 6% or 13%, respectively, over the secretome of PfMig188at the same protein concentration, the simultaneous overexpression of these two genes led to a 20% increase in saccharification efficiency over that observed with PfMig188, which accounted for 82% saccharification of PWS under 20% substrate loading. © 2020 Copyright ©2020 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {The chloroplast is an essential organelle in microalgae for conducting photosynthesis, thus enabling the photoautotrophic growth of microalgae. In addition to photosynthesis, the chloroplast is capable of various biochemical processes for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and terpenoids. Due to these attractive characteristics, there has been increasing interest in the biotechnological utilization of microalgal chloroplast as a sustainable alternative to the conventional production platforms used in industrial biotechnology. Since the first demonstration of microalgal chloroplast transformation, significant development has occurred over recent decades in the manipulation of microalgal chloroplasts through genetic engineering. In the present review, we describe the advantages of the microalgal chloroplast as a production platform for various bioproducts, including recombinant proteins and high-value metabolites, features of chloroplast genetic systems, and the development of transformation methods, which represent important factors for gene expression in the chloroplast. Furthermore, we address the expression of various recombinant proteins in the microalgal chloroplast through genetic engineering, including reporters, biopharmaceutical proteins, and industrial enzymes. Finally, we present many efforts and achievements in the production of high-value metabolites in the microalgal chloroplast through metabolic engineering. Based on these efforts and advances, the microalgal chloroplast represents an economically viable and sustainable platform for biotechnological applications in the near future. © 2018, Springer Media B.V., onderdeel van Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Enzymes are versatile and ecological biocatalysts that are biodegradable, which leads to lower environmental impacts. Peptidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of peptide bonds in proteins. Protein hydrolysis is fundamental in food processing, cleaning products, and pharmaceuticals, among others. Microbial peptidases have been the preferred source for developing new enzymes, besides their advantages compared to plant or animal sources. This is owing to their characteristics, e.g., fast growth, wide diversity of microbial enzymes, longer shelf life, and potential for genetic manipulation of microorganisms. Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions and are highly specific. They generally work in mild conditions and depend on their native conditions, such as pH, temperature, and solvent characteristics. However, the protease used must tolerate operational adversities such as extreme pH and temperature in industrial processes. For this, it is necessary to discover new peptidases and improve existing ones. Methods of metagenomic selection and genome mining or through extremophile diversity (e.g., thermophilic, cold-active, alkali tolerant, acidophilic, and halophilic microorganisms) have been used in the discovery of new enzymes. Protein engineering (by directed evolution, rational design, semi-rational design, and de novo design) and enzyme immobilization are strategies used to improve the catalytic properties, efficiency, and stability of enzymes. This review aimed to critically discuss the current state of the art and future trends of microbial peptidases, highlighting their applications in food processing.

	abstract = {Abstract: Within the marine sphere, host-associated microbiomes are receiving growing attention as prolific sources of novel biocatalysts. Given the known biocatalytic potential of poriferan microbial inhabitants, this review focuses on enzymes from the sponge microbiome, with special attention on their relevant properties and the wide range of their potential biotechnological applications within various industries. Cultivable bacterial and filamentous fungal isolates account for the majority of the enzymatic sources. Hydrolases, mainly glycoside hydrolases and carboxylesterases, are the predominant reported group of enzymes, with varying degrees of tolerance to alkaline pH and growing salt concentrations being common. Prospective areas for the application of these microbial enzymes include biorefinery, detergent, food and effluent treatment industries. Finally, alternative strategies to identify novel biocatalysts from the sponge microbiome are addressed, with an emphasis on modern -omics-based approaches that are currently available in the enzyme research arena. By providing this current overview of the field, we hope to not only increase the appetite of researchers to instigate forthcoming studies but also to stress how basic and applied research can pave the way for new biocatalysts from these symbiotic microbial communities in a productive fashion. Key points: • The sponge microbiome is a burgeoning source of industrial biocatalysts. • Sponge microbial enzymes have useful habitat-related traits for several industries. • Strategies are provided for the future discovery of microbial enzymes from sponges. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Tremendous explosion of population has led to about 200% increment of total energy consumptions in last twenty-five years. Apart from conventional fossil fuel as limited energy source, alternative non-conventional sources are being explored worldwide to cater the energy requirement. Lignocellulosic biomass conversion for biofuel production is an important alternative energy source due to its abundance in nature and creating less harmful impacts on the environment in comparison to the coal or petroleum-based sources. However, lignocellulose biopolymer, the building block of plants, is a recalcitrant substance and difficult to break into desirable products. Commonly used chemical and physical methods for pretreating the substrate are having several limitations. Whereas, utilizing microbial potential to hydrolyse the biomass is an interesting area of research. Because of the complexity of substrate, several enzymes are required that can act synergistically to hydrolyse the biopolymer producing components like bioethanol or other energy substances. Exploring a range of microorganisms, like bacteria, fungi, yeast etc. that utilizes lignocelluloses for their energy through enzymatic breaking down the biomass, is one of the options. Scientists are working upon designing organisms through genetic engineering tools to integrate desired enzymes into a single organism (like bacterial cell). Studies on designer cellulosomes and bacteria consortia development relating consolidated bioprocessing are exciting to overcome the issue of appropriate lignocellulose digestions. This review encompasses up to date information on recent developments for effective microbial degradation processes of lignocelluloses for improved utilization to produce biofuel (bioethanol in particular) from the most plentiful substances of our planet. © 2019},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in nature and has received considerable attention as one of the most promising alternatives to oil resources for the provision of energy and certain raw materials. The phenolic polymer lignin is the second most abundant constituent of this biomass resource and has been shown to have the potential to be converted into industrially important aromatic chemicals after degradation. However, due to its chemical and structural nature, it exhibits high resistance toward mechanical, chemical, and biological degradation, and this causes a major obstacle for achieving efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. In nature, lignin-degrading microorganisms have evolved unique extracellular enzyme systems to decompose lignin using radical mediated oxidative reactions. These microorganisms produce a set of different combinations of enzymes with multiple isozymes and isoforms by responding to various environmental stimuli such as nutrient availability, oxygen concentration and temperature, which are thought to enable effective decomposition of the lignin in lignocellulosic biomass. In this review, we present an overview of the microbial ligninolytic enzyme systems including general molecular aspects, structural features, and systematic differences in each microorganism. We also describe the gene expression pattern and the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of each ligninolytic enzyme with current data. © 2014, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The urgent demand for alternative energy sources has been sparked by the tremendous burden on fossil fuels and the resulting acute energy crisis and climate change issues. Lignocellulosic biomass is a copious renewable and alternative bioresource for the generation of energy fuels and biochemicals in biorefineries. Different pretreatment strategies have been established to overcome biomass recalcitrance and face technological challenges, such as high energy consumption and operational costs and environmental hazards, among many. Biological pretreatment using microbial enzymes is an environmentally benign and low-cost method that holds promising features in the effective pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Due to their versatility and eco-friendliness, cellulases, hemicellulases, and ligninolytic enzymes have been recognized as “green biocatalysts” with a myriad of industrial applications. The current review provides a detailed description of different types of lignocellulolytic enzymes, their mode of action, and their prospective applications in the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. Solid state fermentation holds great promise in the microbial production of lignocellulolytic enzymes owing to its energy efficient, environment friendly, and higher product yielding features utilizing the lignocellulosic feedstocks. The recent trends in the application of enzyme immobilization strategies for improved enzymatic catalysis have been discussed. The major bottlenecks in the bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass using microbial enzymes and future prospects have also been summarized. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Main hurdles of lignin valorization are its diverse chemical composition, recalcitrance, and poor solubility due to high-molecular weight and branched structure. Controlled fragmentation of lignin could lead to its use in higher value products such as binders, coatings, fillers, etc. Oxidative enzymes (i.e., laccases and peroxidases) have long been proposed as a potentially promising tool in lignin depolymerization. However, their application was limited to ambient pH, where lignin is poorly soluble in water. A Finnish biotechnology company, MetGen Oy, that designs and supplies industrial enzymes, has developed and brought to market several lignin oxidizing enzymes, including an extremely alkaline lignin oxidase MetZyme® LIGNO™, a genetically engineered laccase of bacterial origin. This enzyme can function at pH values as high as 10-11 and at elevated temperatures, addressing lignin at its soluble state. In this article, main characteristics of this enzyme as well as its action on bulk lignin coming from an industrial process are demonstrated. Lignin modification by MetZyme® LIGNO™ was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering for monitoring particle size of solubilized lignin. Under highly alkaline conditions, laccase treatment not only decreased molecular weight of lignin but also increased its solubility in water and altered its dispersion properties. Importantly, organic solvent-free soluble lignin fragmentation allowed for robust industrially relevant membrane separation technologies to be applicable for product fractionation. These enzyme-based solutions open new opportunities for biorefinery lignin valorization thus paving the way for economically viable biorefinery business. © 2018 Hämäläinen, Grönroos, Suonpää, Heikkilä, Romein, Ihalainen, Malandra and Birikh.},

	abstract = {                             BACKGROUND: This work explores the feasibility of vinasse as an inexpensive feedstock for industrial biocatalyst production within the context of an integrated sugar beet biorefinery. As an exemplar, production of CV2025 ω-Transaminase (ω-TAm) in Escherichia coli BL21 was studied. RESULTS: Characterisation of vinasse showed that it comprised mainly of glycerol along with several reducing sugars, sugar alcohols, acetate, polyphenols and protein. Preliminary results showed E. coli BL21 cell growth and CV2025 ω-TAm production were feasible in cultures using 17% to 25% (v/v) vinasse with higher concentrations demonstrating inhibitory effects. The d-galactose present in vinasse facilitated auto-induction of the pQR801 plasmid enabling CV2025 ω-TAm expression without addition of expensive Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Assessment of different vinasse pre-processing options confirmed simple dilution of the vinasse was sufficient to reduce the concentration of polyphenols to below inhibitory levels. Optimisation experiments, carried out using a controlled, 24-well microbioreactor platform, showed supplementation of diluted vinasse medium with 10 g L                             −1                              yeast extract enabled enhancements of 2.8, 2.5, 5.4 and 3-fold in specific growth rate, maximum biomass concentration, CV2025 ω-TAm volumetric and specific activity, respectively. Investigation into the metabolic preferences of E. coli BL21 when grown in vinasse showed a preference for D-mannitol utilisation before simultaneous metabolism of glycerol, d-xylitol, d-dulcitol and acetate. Scale-up of optimised conditions for batch CV2025 ω-TAm production to a 7.5 L stirred tank reactor (STR) was demonstrated based on matched volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k                             L                             a). The results showed good comparability with respect to cell growth, substrate consumption and CV2025 ω-TAm production representing over a 700-fold volumetric scale translation. Further enhancements in CV2025 ω-TAm production were possible in the STR when operated at higher k                             L                             a values. CONCLUSION: This work describes the promising application of vinasse for production of microbial enzymes and insights into carbon source utilisation in complex feedstocks. Exploitation of vinasse as a fermentation feedstock could be further extended to other processes involving different microorganisms and target enzymes. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Alkaline lipases are one of the most important industrial enzymes that have several uses in detergents, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, textile, leather and biomedical industries. For screening the lipase-producing bacteria, olive agar A, B, C and Rhodamine B agar were used. The best environmental conditions and their interactions for alkaline lipase production were obtained using Taguchi statistical test. Enzyme purification was carried out by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The best alkaline lipase-producing strain, WS3, isolated from Persian Gulf, was named Marinobacter alkaliphilus ABN-IAUF-1 (GenBank accession number: KP403723). The maximum enzyme activity of 37.00 (μ/ml) was measured in the presence of coconut oil as the carbon source in oil broth medium after 48-h incubation at the pH 8.00 and 30 °C. The most effective factors in enzyme production were nitrogen and carbon sources with 32 and 25% of influence, respectively. Precipitation and dialysis increased the enzyme purity 1.90–2.33 times. The total enzyme activity of 925.00 ± 20.00 U in the oil broth, 96.00 ± 7.00 U after precipitation with ammonium sulfate and 60.00 ± 5.00 U after dialysis was measured. The molecular weight of alkaline lipase was measured as 55 kDa. In conclusion, this is the first report of production of alkaline lipase by a halo-alkalophilic bacterium, Marinobacter alkaliphilus ABN-IAUF-1, that was obtained from Persian Gulf, Iran.

	abstract = {Various agro-industrial wastes are utilized as fermentation raw materials and are considered promising biorefinery substrates. The search for novel substrates is an ongoing quest, particularly for those residues that do not interfere with the food chain and do not need arable land. Here, a halophytic biomass from Arthrocnemum macrostachyum was utilized as a substrate to produce multienzyme preparation from two endophytic strains of Bacillus sp. TKE1 and TKE4. Initially, a one-factor-at-a-time approach was adopted to investigate the appropriate levels of the variables affecting enzyme production. Consequently, the central composite design was used to optimize the enzymes produced by the two strains. Among the enzymes studied, amylase and xylanase activity were found to have significant R2 values (> 90%) in ANOVA; hence, these were further optimized. Response surface optimization of the enzymes production resulted in the final titers of 4.3 IU mL−1 of amylase and 3.5 IU mL−1 of xylanase by TKE1 while 3.2 IU mL−1 of amylase and 2.9 IU mL−1 of xylanase by TKE4. The SEM analysis revealed the separation of substrate fibers, loosening of the matrix, porous, and increased contact surface. The FTIR results showed significant changes in the lignin-related bands (1518 to 1257 cm−1), changes in the bands for cellulosic component (1635.63 cm−1 and 1608.63 cm−1), starch content (1064.70 cm−1), and β-glycosidic linkage (848.67 and 864.10 cm−1), indicating the degradation of the substrate by the strains. The study concludes that the halophytic biomass from A. macrostachyum can serve as a substrate for industrial enzyme production. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {Electromicrobial production (EMP) processes, in which electricity or electrochemically-derived mediator molecules serve as energy sources to drive biochemical processes, represent an attractive strategy for the conversion of CO2 into carbon-based products. However, these systems have yet to be employed on an industrial scale, limiting our understanding of their potential performance and environmental benefits/impacts. We describe the development and application of a comprehensive framework to analyze EMP systems relying on reactor, process, and life cycle impact models. This framework is used to analyze three proposed EMP systems relying on formate, H2, and acetate as intermediate molecules, each producing three hypothetical products: biomass, lactic acid, and industrial enzymes. Physics-based bioreactor models predict that EMP systems can achieve productivities up to 0.65 g L−1 h−1 for biomass production and 0.42 g L−1 h−1 for the production of lactic acid. Despite improved solubility of formate as a substrate, formate-fed EMP systems do not lead to improved productivities compared to H2-fed systems due to O2 gas-liquid mass transfer limitations (for biomass and enzymes) or salinity-induced toxicity issues (for lactic acid). Process models revealed that substrate generation was by far the largest energy demand of the EMP systems, followed by carbon capture and ammonia production, while energy required for gas-liquid mass transfer and fluid mixing accounted for only a small fraction of the systems’ energy footprints. Life cycle impact model results demonstrated that EMP systems can achieve a smaller carbon footprint than traditional bioprocessing strategies provided the electric grid supplying electricity to the EMP system is composed of at least 90% renewable energy sources. For each of the three products we consider, the H2-mediated Knallgas bacteria system achieves the lowest overall global warming potential, indicating that this EMP strategy may be best-suited for industrial efforts based on current technology. EMP systems also would use ∼95% less land compared to traditional bioprocesses. We also identify environmental hotspots and process limitations that are key targets for future engineering and research efforts for each EMP system. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of an integrated assessment framework and should help guide the design of working, scalable, and sustainable electromicrobial production systems. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

It represents as one of the third largest group of industrial enzyme and finds its applications in detergents, leather industry, pharmaceutical industry etc. Among the different vegetable waste products, peel of Manihot esculenta (Tapioca/cassava) was used as substrates for the production of protease by Bacillus sp. The aim of our study is to utilize the waste of Tapioca peel as input for protease production using Bacillus sp. The protease produced by Bacillus sp from M. esculenta showed a pH of 10 and temperature of about 30°C. Protease produced was tested for possible industrial applications. This enzyme shows high capacity in removing the blood stain, dehairing the animal skin, digestion of natural proteins and bioprocessing of used X-ray film. The wash performance analysis of blood stains on cotton fabrics showed that blood stains were completely removed within 15 minutes of incubation of fabrics along with enzyme. Complete hair removal of goat skin by the protease achieved within 12 hours of incubation at 30°C. This enzyme has the ability to dissolve the blood clot and coagulated egg within 20 minutes of incubation. Enymatic hydrolysis of gelatin from waste X-ray films was also investigated. At the end of the treatment, gelatin layer was completely removed leaving the polyester film clean. Gelatin hydrolysis was monitored by measuring increase in turbidity. Gelatin layer was removed completely within 10 minutes of addition of enzyme. The protease produced exhibits high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study was a humble attempt towards the production of protease and to check their efficiency in industrial applications. These properties indicate the possibilities of enzyme usage in various industries and it can be exploited commercially in future.},

	abstract = {Many microorganisms feed on the tissue and recalcitrant bone materials from dead animals, however little is known about the collaborative effort and characteristics of their enzymes. In this study, microbial metagenomes from symbionts of the marine bone-dwelling worm Osedax mucofloris, and from microbial biofilms growing on experimentally deployed bone surfaces were screened for specialized bone-degrading enzymes. A total of 2,043 taxonomically (closest match within 40 phyla) and functionally (1 proteolytic and 9 glycohydrolytic activities) diverse and non-redundant sequences (median pairwise identity of 23.6%) encoding such enzymes were retrieved. The taxonomic assignation and the median identity of 72.2% to homologous proteins reflect microbial and functional novelty associated to a specialized bone-degrading marine community. Binning suggests that only one generalist hosting all ten targeted activities, working in synergy with multiple specialists hosting a few or individual activities. Collagenases were the most abundant enzyme class, representing 48% of the total hits. A total of 47 diverse enzymes, representing 8 hydrolytic activities, were produced in Escherichia coli, whereof 13 were soluble and active. The biochemical analyses revealed a wide range of optimal pH (4.0–7.0), optimal temperature (5–65 °C), and of accepted substrates, specific to each microbial enzyme. This versatility may contribute to a high environmental plasticity of bone-degrading marine consortia that can be confronted to diverse habitats and bone materials. Through bone-meal degradation tests, we further demonstrated that some of these enzymes, particularly those from Flavobacteriaceae and Marinifilaceae, may be an asset for development of new value chains in the biorefinery industry. © 2021},

	abstract = {The market for pectinolytic enzymes is continually expanding. In addition to the food, animal feed, textile and paper industries, pectinases have recently found application in the field of biorefinery. However, the industrial production of these enzymes is associated with high costs. Thus, the search for new source of microbial enzymes with low culture requirements, or from new substrates that allow the development of cost-effective and ecofriendly processes is of utmost importance. In this study, an unusual microbial source was postulated to produce pectinases from an uncommon agro-waste substrate. This study is the first report that reveals the production of pectinases by Crypthecodinium cohnii using as culture media liquors obtained after organosolv pretreatment of exhausted olive pomace (EOP). Results showed that using EOP as substrate, this strain was able to produce 42.15 ± 0.41 U/mL of extracellular polygalacturonase. Additionally, the valorization of EOP as a substrate to produce pectinases can be enhanced through the extraction of lipids rich in omega-3, making it a cost-effective and zero-waste process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cellulases are the one of the most highly demanded industrial biocatalysts due to their versatile applications, such as in the biorefinery industry. However, relatively poor efficiency and high production costs are included as the key industrial constraints that hinder enzyme production and utilization at economic scale. Furthermore, the production and functional efficiency of the β-glucosidase (BGL) enzyme is usually found to be relatively low among the cellulase cocktail produced. Thus, the current study focuses on fungi-mediated improvement of BGL enzyme in the presence of a rice straw-derived graphene-silica-based nanocomposite (GSNCs), which has been characterized using various techniques to analyze its physicochemical properties. Under optimized conditions of solid-state fermentation (SSF), co-fermentation using co-cultured cellulolytic enzyme has been done, and maximum enzyme production of 42 IU/gds FP, 142 IU/gds BGL, and 103 IU/gds EG have been achieved at a 5 mg concentration of GSNCs. Moreover, at a 2.5 mg concentration of nanocatalyst, the BGL enzyme showed its thermal stability at 60°C and 70 °C by holding its half-life relative activity for 7 h, while the same enzyme demonstrated pH stability at pH 8.0 and 9.0 for the 10 h. This thermoalkali BGL enzyme might be useful for the long-term bioconversion of cellulosic biomass into sugar. © 2023},

	abstract = {Lignin, the most abundant renewable aromatic compound in nature, is an excellent feedstock for value-added bioproducts manufacturing; while the intrinsic heterogeneity and recalcitrance of which hindered the efficient lignin biorefinery and utilization. Compared with chemical processing, bioprocessing with microbial and enzymatic catalysis is a clean and efficient method for lignin depolymerization and conversion. Generally, lignin bioprocessing involves lignin decomposition to lignin-based aromatics via extracellular microbial enzymes and further converted to value-added bioproducts through microbial metabolism. In the review, the most recent advances in degradation and conversion of lignin to value-added bioproducts catalyzed by microbes and enzymes were summarized. The lignin-degrading microorganisms of white-rot fungi, brown-rot fungi, soft-rot fungi, and bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were comparatively analyzed. The catalytic metabolism of the microbial lignin-degrading enzymes of laccase, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, biphenyl bond cleavage enzyme, versatile peroxidase, and β-etherize was discussed. The microbial metabolic process of H-lignin, G-lignin, S-lignin based derivatives, protocatechuic acid, and catechol was reviewed. Lignin was depolymerized to lignin-derived aromatic compounds by the secreted enzymes of fungi and bacteria, and the aromatics were converted to value-added compounds through microbial catalysis and metabolic engineering. The review also proposes new insights for future work to overcome the recalcitrance of lignin and convert it to value-added bioproducts by microbial and enzymatic catalysis. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Fungi enriched from decaying biomass and surface soil mixture displayed an array of strong cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. Strains SG2 and SG4 produced a promising array of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes including β-glucosidase, usually low in cultures of Trichoderma species. Nucleotide sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of rRNA gene revealed that strains SG2 and SG4 are closely related to Trichoderma inhamatum, Trichoderma piluliferum, and Trichoderma aureoviride. Trichoderma sp. SG2 crude culture supernatant correspondingly displayed as much as 9.84 ± 1.12, 48.02 ± 2.53, and 30.10 ± 1.11 units mL−1 of cellulase, xylanase, and β-glucosidase in 30 min assay. Ten times dilution of culture supernatant of strain SG2 revealed that total activities were about 5.34, 8.45, and 2.05 orders of magnitude higher than observed in crude culture filtrate for cellulase, xylanase, and β-glucosidase, respectively, indicating that more enzymes are present to contact with substrates in biomass saccharification. In parallel experiments, Trichoderma species SG2 and SG4 produced more β-glucosidase than the industrial strain Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30.

	abstract = {Baicalein and wogonin, two health-promoting flavonoid aglycones in Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi roots, have better bioactivity and bioavailability than their glycoside precursors (baicalin and wogonoside). The search for novel microorganisms for the fermentation of S. baicalensis roots to improve the yields of baicalein and wogonin is of great interest in the food and nutraceutical industries. In this study, a novel endophytic fungus (Penicillium rubens) capable of producing cellulase (0.82 ± 0.12 U/mL) and β-glucosidase (4.55 ± 0.97 U/mL) was used to ferment S. baicalensis roots to obtain high yields of baicalein and wogonin. Semi-solid-state fermentation with homogeneous fungal cultures was found to be the appropriate strategy. Under the optimal fermentation parameters (temperature 30 °C, inoculation dose of fungal cultures 4 mL/g, and time 60 h), the yields of baicalein and wogonin (46.95 ± 4.98 mg/g DW and 31.41 ± 9.36 mg/g DW) from S. baicalensis roots were tremendously increased by 16.13-fold and 15.47-fold over control, respectively. Results of industrial enzyme bioprocessing and scanning electron microscope indicated that the remarkable increase in aglycone product yields could be due to the synergistic effects of cellulase and β-glucosidase produced by P. rubens on cell wall hydrolysis and glycoside deglycosylation. In addition, extracts of S. baicalensis roots fermented by P. rubens showed a significant increase in antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Overall, the semi-solid-state fermentation of S. baicalensis roots using the novel P. rubens was an effective strategy that could yield high quantities of baicalein and wogonin, which had promising potential in the food and nutraceutical industries.

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic materials form the building block of 50% of plant biomass comprising non-chewable agri-components like wheat straw, rice stubbles, wood shavings and other crop residues. The degradation of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose is complicated and presently being done by chemical process for industrial application through a very energy intensive process. Lignin degradation is primarily an oxidative process where the enzyme lignin peroxidase digests the polymer into smaller fragments. Being a recalcitrant component, higher lignin content poses a challenge of lower recovery of product for industrial use. Globally, the scientists are working on leveraging fungal biotechnology for using the lignocellulose degrading enzymes secreted by actinomycetes and basidiomycetes fungal groups. Enzymes contributing to degradation of lignin are mainly performing the function of modifying the lignin and degrading the lignin. Ligninolytic enzymes do not act as an independent reaction but are vital to complete the degradation process. Microbial enzyme technology is an emerging green tool in industrial biotechnology for commercial application. Bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass is challenged by limitations in enzymatic and conversion process where pretreatment and separation steps are done to remove lignin and hydrolyze carbohydrate into fermentable sugars. This review highlights recent advances in molecular biotechnology, lignin valorization, sequencing, decipher microbial membership, and characterize enzyme diversity through ‘omics’ techniques. Emerging techniques to characterize the interwoven metabolism and spatial interactions between anaerobes are also reviewed, which will prove critical to developing a predictive understanding of anaerobic communities to guide in microbiome engineering This requires more synergistic collaborations from microbial biotechnologists, bioprocess engineers, enzymologists, and other biotechnological fields. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Lignin valorization can be obtained through cleavage of selected bonds by microbial enzymes, in which lignin is segregated from cellulose and hemicellulose and abundant phenolic compounds can be provided. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. Q18, previously isolated from rotten wood in China, was used to degrade alkali lignin and raw lignocellulosic material. Gel-permeation chromatography, field-emission scanning electron microscope, and GC–MS were combined to investigate the degradation process. The GC–MS results revealed that the quantities of aromatic compounds with phenol ring from lignin increased significantly after incubation with Pseudomonas sp. Q18, which indicated the degradation of lignin. According to the lignin-derived metabolite analysis, it was proposed that a DyP-type peroxidase (PmDyP) might exist in strain Q18. Thereafter, the gene of PmDyP was cloned and expressed, after which the recombinant PmDyP was purified and the enzymatic kinetics of PmDyP were assayed. According to results, PmDyP showed promising characteristics for lignocellulosic biodegradation in biorefinery. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic plant biomass is the most abundant carbon source in the planet, which makes it a potential substrate for biorefinery. It consists of polysaccharides and other molecules with applications in pharmaceutical, food and feed, cosmetics, paper and textile industries. The exploitation of these resources requires the hydrolysis of the plant cell wall, which is a complex process. Aiming to discover novel fungal natural isolates with lignocellulolytic capacities, a screening for feruloyl esterase activity was performed in samples taken from different metal surfaces. An extracellular enzyme extract from the most promising candidate, the natural isolate Alternaria alternata PDA1, was analyzed. The feruloyl esterase activity of the enzyme extract was characterized, determining the pH and temperature optima (pH 5.0 and 55–60 °C, respectively), thermal stability and kinetic parameters, among others. Proteomic analyses derived from two-dimensional gels allowed the identification and classification of 97 protein spots from the extracellular proteome. Most of the identified proteins belonged to the carbohydrates metabolism group, particularly plant cell wall degradation. Enzymatic activities of the identified proteins (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, β-xylosidase and xylanase) of the extract were also measured. These findings confirm A. alternata PDA1 as a promising lignocellulolytic enzyme producer. Significance: Although plant biomass is an abundant material that can be potentially utilized by several industries, the effective hydrolysis of the recalcitrant plant cell wall is not a straightforward process. As this hydrolysis occurs in nature relying almost solely on microbial enzymatic systems, it is reasonable to infer that further studies on lignocellulolytic enzymes will discover new sustainable industrial solutions. The results included in this paper provide a promising fungal candidate for biotechnological processes to obtain added value from plant byproducts and analogous substrates. Moreover, the proteomic analysis of the secretome of a natural isolate of Alternaria sp. grown in the presence of one of the most used vegetal substrates on the biofuels industry (sugar beet pulp) sheds light on the extracellular enzymatic machinery of this fungal plant pathogen, and can be potentially applied to developing new industrial enzymatic tools. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to analyze in depth the secreted enzyme extract of the plant pathogen Alternaria when grown on a lignocellulosic substrate, identifying its proteins by means of MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and characterizing its feruloyl esterase, cellulase and xylanolytic activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Our results showed that the different compositions of a motif located on L2 affect the electrostatic potentials of substrate binding surfaces, which in turn affect substrate specificities of AA10 LPMOs.

	abstract = {DyP-type peroxidases (DyPs) are microbial enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of substrates, including synthetic dyes, lignin-derived compounds, and metals, such as Mn2+ and Fe2+, and have enormous biotechnological potential in biorefineries. However, many questions on the molecular basis of enzyme function and stability remain unanswered. In this work, high-resolution structures of PpDyP wild-type and two engineered variants (6E10 and 29E4) generated by directed evolution were obtained. The X-ray crystal structures revealed the typical ferredoxin-like folds, with three heme access pathways, two tunnels, and one cavity, limited by three long loops including catalytic residues. Variant 6E10 displays significantly increased loops’ flexibility that favors function over stability: despite the considerably higher catalytic efficiency, this variant shows poorer protein stability compared to wild-type and 29E4 variants. Constant-pH MD simulations revealed a more positively charged microenvironment near the heme pocket of variant 6E10, particularly in the neutral to alkaline pH range. This microenvironment affects enzyme activity by modulating the pKa of essential residues in the heme vicinity and should account for variant 6E10 improved activity at pH 7–8 compared to the wild-type and 29E4 that show optimal enzymatic activity close to pH 4. Our findings shed light on the structure–function relationships of DyPs at the molecular level, including their pH-dependent conformational plasticity. These are essential for understanding and engineering the catalytic properties of DyPs for future biotechnological applications. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Transforming global agricultural waste into eco-friendly products like industrial enzymes through bioconversion can help address sustainability challenges aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Present study explored the production of high-yield food-grade cellulolytic enzymes from Trichoderma reesei MTCC 4876, using a novel media formulation with a combination of waste sorghum grass and cottonseed oil cake (3:1). Optimization of physical and environmental parameters, along with the screening and optimization of media components, led to an upscaled process in a novel 6-L solid-state fermentation (SSF)-packed bed reactor (PBR) with a substrate loading of 200 g. Saturated forced aeration proved crucial, resulting in high fungal biomass (31.15 ± 0.63 mg glucosamine/gm dry fermented substrate) and high yield cellulase (20.64 ± 0.36 FPU/g-ds) and xylanase (16,186 ± 912 IU/g-ds) production at an optimal airflow rate of 0.75 LPM. The PBR exhibited higher productivity than shake flasks for all the enzyme systems. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration of the crude cellulolytic extract achieved 94% and 71% recovery, respectively, with 13.54 FPU/mL activity in the cellulolytic enzyme concentrate. The concentrate displayed stability across wide pH and temperature ranges, with a half-life of 24.5-h at 50 °C. The cellulase concentrate, validated for food-grade safety, complies with permissible limits for potential pathogens, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and pesticide residue. It significantly improved apple juice clarity (94.37 T%) by reducing turbidity (21%) and viscosity (99%) while increasing total reducing sugar release by 63% compared with untreated juice. The study also highlighted the potential use of lignin-rich fermented end residue for fuel pellets within permissible SOx emission limits, offering sustainable biorefinery prospects. Utilizing agro wastes in a controlled bioreactor environment underscores the potential for efficient large-scale cellulase production, enabling integration into food-grade applications and presenting economic benefits to fruit juice industries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fruit peels are a rich source of cellulose, hemicellulose, phenolic compounds, and terpenic compounds. Thus, they have the potential to be a novel renewable, sustainable, and low-cost raw material (source) for the production of several value-added products based on framework and concepts such as waste hierarchy that includes biofertilizers, dietary fiber, animal feed, industrial enzymes, substrate for the bioactive compounds production, synthesis of nanomaterials, and clean energy (from residual biomass). With a view of evaluating the environmental burden of biorefinery, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for a representative citrus waste (CW) biorefinery. The functional unit used for LCA was set as 2500 kg of CW processed. The overall GWP was observed to be 937.3 kg CO2 equivalent per 2500 kg of CW processed. On further analysis of the environmental impact, it was found that different steps contributed significantly, as shown by the various environmental indicator values. Alternative advanced process intensification technologies like microwave and ultrasound-assisted steps replacing the conventional steps when implemented show considerable reduction in environmental indicator values. The variations in the contribution to environmental indicators should be considered during the design and process selection of biorefineries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Feather waste, a by-product of the poultry industry, is rich in proteins, peptides, and amino acids. Improper disposal of feathers can cause environmental pollution. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is a viable alternative to submerged fermentation due to its simplicity, productivity, and lower cost. The study goal is a biorefinery of chicken feather waste supplemented with wheat bran using a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain to produce soluble proteins and a serine alkaline protease. Plackett-Burman Design and Central Composite Design were utilized in a statistical-mathematical model to optimize the process. Multi-factorial design optimization resulted in 80 % substrate degradation efficiency, an alkaline protease with dual activities (1423 proteolytic units and 190 keratinolytic units), 214 mg soluble proteins/g substrate, and 87 % model validation. Scaling up the SSF process to 50 g of substrate significantly enhanced the end products of feather biodegradation to 1616 proteolytic units, 2844 keratinolytic units, and 127 mg soluble proteins/g substrate. Aim and scope of the manuscript: The aim of the present study is to utilize chicken feather waste (alone or supplemented with other materials) through recombinant Bacillus subtilis cells using solid state fermentation (SSF) at a laboratory scale. The plan study provides a promising waste management in the environmental field concerning biodegradation of such recalcitrant keratinous wastes supplemented with agricultural residues via recombinant microorganism. On semi-pilot scale, high production and quality of soluble protein, protease, and keratinase activity were produced according to the statistically optimised first stage fermentation in the laboratory scale. The bioconversion process took place as a major goal to obtain valuable products, with low utilities and energy requirements. Therefore, this will consider as an economically feasible and environmentally friendly alternative. Moreover, this study is considered as first step fermentation for feather waste to pave the road for directing it to a second step fermentation for biogas production and bioenergy generation through bio-electrochemical systems (Manuscript under publication). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective: Glucuronoyl esterase (GE) is an emerging enzyme that improves fractionation of lignin-carbohydrate complexes. However, the commercial availability of GE is limited, which hinders the research of GE-based bioprocesses for its industrial application in lignocellulose biorefineries. This study evaluated a workable, cost-effective, and commercially scalable production strategy to improve the ease of GE-based research. This strategy consisted of a constitutive and methanol-free enzyme production step coupled with a two-step filtration process. The aim was to determine if this strategy can yield copious amounts of GE, by secretion into the extracellular medium with an acceptable purity that could allow its direct application. This approach was further validated for cellobiose dehydrogenase, another emerging lignocellulose degrading enzyme which is scarcely available at high cost. Results: The secreted recombinant enzymes were functionally produced in excess of levels previously reported for constitutive production (1489-2780 mg L-1), and were secreted at moderate to high percentages of the total extracellular protein (51-94%). The constant glycerol feed, implemented during fed-batch fermentation, lead to a decline in growth rate and plateaued productivity. Tangential flow ultrafiltration was used to concentrate cell-free enzyme extracts 5-6-fold, reaching enzyme activity levels (1020-202 U L-1) that could allow their direct application. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has remained a latent alternative resource to be the main substitute for oil and its derivatives in a biorefinery concept. However, its complex structure and the underdeveloped technologies for its large-scale processing keep it in a state of constant study trying to establish a consolidated process. In intensive processes, enzymes have been shown to be important molecules for the fractionation and conversion of LCB into biofuels and high-value-added molecules. However, operational challenges must be overcome before enzyme technology can be the main resource for obtaining second-generation sugars. The use of additives is shown to be a suitable strategy to improve the saccharification process. This review describes the mechanisms, roles, and effects of using additives, such as surfactants, biosurfactants, and non-catalytic proteins, separately and integrated into the enzymatic hydrolysis process of lignocellulosic biomass. In doing so, it provides a technical background in which operational biomass processing hurdles such as solids and enzymatic loadings, pretreatment burdens, and the unproductive adsorption phenomenon can be addressed. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Typically, citrus waste is composted on land by producers or used as livestock feed. However, the biorefinery approach offers a sustainable and economically viable solution for managing and valorizing these agricultural residues. This review examines research from the period 2014 to 2024. Citrus waste can be utilized initially by extracting the present phytochemicals and subsequently by producing value-added products using it as a raw material. The phytochemicals reported as extracted include essential oils (primarily limonene), pectin, polyphenolic components, micro- and nano-cellulose, proteins, and enzymes, among others. The components produced from the waste include bioethanol, biogas, volatile acids, biodiesel, microbial enzymes, and levulinic acid, among others. The review indicates that citrus waste has technical, economic, and environmental potential for utilization at the laboratory scale and, in some cases, at the pilot scale. However, research on refining pathways, optimization, and scalability must continue to be an active field of investigation. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Enzymes are crucial for various technological applications, but their inherent instability and short lifespan pose challenges. This study presents facile immobilized enzyme technology with the development of thermoresponsive enzyme-polymer conjugates (EPCs), using glucose oxidase (GOx) as a model enzyme, to address these limitations. By conjugating heteropolymers to the glycan moieties of GOx through a precise in situ polymerization process, we could modulate the lower critical solution temperature of the EPCs, enhancing enzyme performance without compromising its active site. The EPCs demonstrate a switchable behavior that facilitates efficient homogeneous catalysis and easy heterogeneous separation, reducing costs and environmental impact in industrial applications. Our strategy presents a versatile platform for creating efficient biocatalysts with tunable properties, marking a step forward in sustainable and cost-effective bioprocessing. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Microbial enzymes such as protease and amylase are valuable enzymes with various applications, widely investigated for their applications in degradation of organic waste, biofuel industries, agricultural, pharmaceuticals, chemistry, and biotechnology. In particular, extremophiles play an important role in biorefinery due to their novel metabolic products such as high value catalytic enzymes that are active even under harsh environmental conditions. Due to their potentials and very broad activities, this study isolated, investigated, and characterized the protease-and amylase-producing bacterial strain FW2 that was isolated from food waste. Strain FW2 belongs to the genus Bacillus and was found to be closest to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 7T with a similarity of 99.86%. This strain was able to degrade organic compounds at temperatures from −6◦ C to 75◦ C (but weak at 80◦ C) under a wide pH range (4.5–12) and high-salinity conditions up to 35% NaCl. Maximum enzyme production was obtained at 1200 ± 23.4 U/mL for protease and 2400 ± 45.8 U/mL for amylase for 4 days at pH 7–7.5, 40–45◦ C, and 0–10% NaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular weights of purified protease were 28 kDa and 44 kDa, corresponding to alkaline protease (AprM) and neutral protease (NprM), respectively, and molecular weight of α-amylase was 55 kDa. Degradation food waste was determined after 15 days, observing a 69% of volume decrease. A potential commercial extremozyme-producing bacteria such as strain FW2 may be a promising contributor to waste degradation under extreme environmental conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Enzymatic biocatalysis has a vast reputation on an industrial scale. The major hindrance faced by enzymes is their denaturation under various conditions. In this study, we report that the activity and stability of enzymes can be enhanced by their immobilization on a novel synthesized polypyrrole-methyl anthranilate-titanium oxide nanocomposite containing amine groups. We demonstrated this by successfully immobilizing lipase from Rhizopus oryzae on a Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC by physical adsorption and a glutaraldehyde-activated covalent coupling procedure. The catalytic efficiencies of the free and immobilized preparations were determined for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate. The covalently immobilized lipase displayed a significantly higher activity yield (effectiveness factor of 0.97) in comparison with the adsorbed counterpart (effectiveness factor of 0.86). The binding of lipase to the Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. TGA and DTA were performed to investigate the thermal stability of the synthesised biocatalysts. The storage stability, solvent tolerance, and reusability of the resulting nanobiocatalyst and the effect of pH and temperature on its catalytic activities were also investigated. The prepared nanobiocatalysts displayed remarkably improved activity in terms of solvent tolerance (activity recovery of 150% and 125% in acetone and isopropanol, respectively) in comparison with its free counterpart. We envisage that the covalent binding method played a profound role in enhancing the properties of the enzyme immobilized on the Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC. In view of the abovementioned results, a hydrolytic enzyme immobilized on this functionalized TiO2 nanocarrier can be used as a stable and effective nanobiocatalyst with vital implications for industrial biotechnology. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.},

	abstract = {Heterologous expression of the carbohydrate-active enzymes in microorganisms is a promising approach to produce bio-based compounds, such as fuels, nutraceuticals and other value-added products from sustainable lignocellulosic sources. Several microorganisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans, have unique characteristics desirable for a biorefinery production approach like well-known genetic tools, thermotolerance, high fermentative capacity and product tolerance, and high amount of recombinant enzyme secretion. These microbial factories are already stablished in the heterologous production of the carbohydrate-active enzymes to produce, among others, ethanol, xylooligosaccharides and the valuable coniferol. A complete biocatalyst able to heterologous express the CAZymes of glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases and auxiliary activities families could release these compounds faster, with higher yield and specificity. Recent advances in the synthetic biology tools could expand the number and diversity of enzymes integrated in these microorganisms, and also modify those already integrated.

	abstract = {The catalytic transformation (hydrolysis) of complex lignocellulosic polysaccharides into fermentable monosaccharides is crucial for producing bioethanol. Hydrolysis of various lignocellulosic biomasses can be achieved via traditional acid treatment (hydrochloric and sulfuric acid) and enzymatic catalysis. Considering the high specificity, selectivity, and prospective biocatalytic performance, enzyme biocatalysts are the preferred choice for an efficient and eco-friendlier deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomasses into simple fermentable sugars. Enzymes are a fascinating class of biodegradable catalysts that consume low energy and catalyze functioning under ambient environmental conditions. Recently, applying immobilized enzymes has emerged as a prodigious option in lignocellulosic biomass valorization. Immobilizing various enzymes, including cellulase, cellobiose, β-glucosidase, laccase, and xylanase, on nano-support materials to constitute nanobiocatalyst has shown increased biocatalytic efficiency and stability. Furthermore, enzyme immobilization on magnetic nanomaterials promotes facile retrieval, separation, and recycling of biocatalysts. Consequently, the development and implementation of nanobiocatalytic systems offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for the catalytic deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. This review article provides a comprehensive insight into contemporary developments and the application of nanomaterial-immobilized biocatalysts to catalyze the degradation of lignocellulosic biomasses. After a succinct overview of characteristics of key lignocellulosic biorefinery enzymes and immobilization techniques, and novel material supports, the application of nanomaterial-immobilized cellulase-based biocatalysts to catalyze the degradation and conversion of lignocellulosic biomasses is thoroughly vetted by compiling with state-of-the-art examples. Moreover, reactors for immobilized cellulase systems, major challenges, research gaps, and future endeavors are also directed. In conclusion, this study provides a new horizon to bridging the main knowledge gaps and explicit barriers of these bioprocesses to harnessing the full adventure of enzyme immobilization to realize sustainable biorefinery. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Agricultural residue is produced in large quantities during crop harvesting, and open burning of this waste causes environmental pollution and health risks. Due to the structural complexity of the lignocellulose and problems associated with physical and chemical methods of its pretreatments, there is an utmost need for an eco-friendly pretreatment strategy. Biological pretreatment involving microorganisms and their enzymes is an environment-benign and economic process due to lack of release or requirement of toxic chemicals during the process. Among microorganisms, filamentous fungi (mainly Basidiomycetes) with efficient enzymatic machinery have been used in efficient delignification and bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Enzyme-mediated pretreatment has further improved the saccharification of plant biomass with no sugar loss as in case of microbial pretreatment. Composting, ensiling, solid state fermentation, and biogas production are based on biological pretreatment, which are used for the generation of value-added products. Biological pretreatment does not require/release toxic chemicals but, is highly useful in detoxification of such toxic compounds. Biological pretreatment is significantly affected by biotic and abiotic factors. Pretreated biomass is hydrolyzed by cellulases and xylanases into sugars that are fermented into biofuels, organic acids, enzymes, and other products. The slow and long incubation nature of biological pretreatment has been overcome by combining with milder physico-chemical methods. Furthermore, the consolidated bioprocessing-based biorefinery approach has enhanced the potential of biological pretreatment by involving microbial consortium for the production of biofuels and other value-added products in a single step. Therefore, biological pretreatment-based biorefinery approach would be quite beneficial for the large-scale production of value-added products from lignocellulose with concomitant reduction in environmental pollution and solid waste management. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Aspergillus sp. plays an essential role in lignocellulosic biomass recycling and is also exploited as cell factories for the production of industrial enzymes. This study profiled the secretome of Aspergillus fumigatus when grown with cellulose, xylan and starch by high throughput quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Post translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play a critical role in protein functions. However, our understanding of the PTMs in secretory proteins is limited. Here, we present the identification of PTMs such as deamidation of secreted proteins of A. fumigatus. This study quantified diverse groups of extracellular secreted enzymes and their functional classification revealed cellulases and glycoside hydrolases (32.9%), amylases (0.9%), hemicellulases (16.2%), lignin degrading enzymes (8.1%), peptidases and proteases (11.7%), chitinases, lipases and phosphatases (7.6%), and proteins with unknown function (22.5%). The comparison of quantitative iTRAQ results revealed that cellulose and xylan stimulates expression of specific cellulases and hemicellulases, and their abundance level as a function of substrate. In-depth data analysis revealed deamidation as a major PTM of key cellulose hydrolyzing enzymes like endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and glucosidases. Hemicellulose degrading endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, monosidases, xylosidases, lignin degrading laccase, isoamyl alcohol oxidase and oxidoreductases were also found to be deamidated. Biological significance: The filamentous fungi play an essential role in lignocellulosic biomass recycling and fungal strains belonging to Aspergillus were also exploited as cell factories for the production of organic acids, pharmaceuticals, and industrially important enzymes. In this study, extracellular proteins secreted by thermophilic A. fumigatus when grown with cellulose, xylan and starch were profiled using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) by adopting liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The comparison of quantitative iTRAQ results revealed that cellulose and xylan stimulate expression of specific cellulases and hemicellulases, and expression level as a function of substrate. Post translational modifications revealed deamidation of key cellulases including endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and glucosidases; and hemicellulases and lignin degrading enzymes. The knowledge on deamidated enzymes along with specific sites of modifications could be crucial information for further functional studies of these enzymes of A. fumigatus. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Enzymatic depolymerization of recalcitrant polysaccharides plays a key role in accessing the renewable energy stored within lignocellulosic biomass, and natural biodiversities may be explored to discover microbial enzymes that have evolved to conquer this task in various environments. Here, a metagenome from a thermophilic microbial community was mined to yield a novel, thermostable cellulase, named mgCel6A, with activity on an industrial cellulosic substrate (sulfite-pulped Norway spruce) and a glucomannanase side activity. The enzyme consists of a glycoside hydrolase family 6 catalytic domain (GH6) and a family 2 carbohydrate binding module (CBM2) that are connected by a linker rich in prolines and threonines. MgCel6A exhibited maximum activity at 85C and pH 5.0 on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), but in prolonged incubations with the industrial substrate, the highest yields were obtained at 60C, pH 6.0. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated a Tm(app) of 76C. Both functional data and the crystal structure, solved at 1.88 Å resolution, indicate that mgCel6A is an endoglucanase. Comparative studies with a truncated variant of the enzyme showed that the CBM increases substrate binding, while not affecting thermal stability. Importantly, at higher substrate concentrations the full-length enzyme was outperformed by the catalytic domain alone, underpinning previous suggestions that CBMs may be less useful in high-consistency bioprocessing. © 2018 Jensen et al.

The Indian biotechnology arena is promising for advance and pioneering growth with its immense growth potential which could play a significant role toward India’s contribution to global industrial biotechnology. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economies in the world and the fifth largest overall, with a GDP (gross domestic product) of $2.94 trillion. Biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT) are the key drivers contributing to this growth which constitutes approximately 5% of the country’s total annual GDP. Indian biotechnology growth is fueled by bio-pharmaceutical, bio-industrial, bio-services, bio-agricultural, and bioinformatics, and among them, the bio-industrial area is one of the most promising and advanced. New approaches which Indian industrial biotechnology is exploring, include harnessing microorganisms for the production of value-added bioactive ingredients such as industrial enzymes, organic acids, bulk chemicals, and single-cell proteins, which have played a predominant role in the overall development of biotechnology after bio-pharmaceuticals. The above factors made India one of the world’s top 12 destinations for biotechnology.

	abstract = {Nitrogen is essential for life and its transformations are an important part of the global biogeochemical cycle. Being an essential nutrient, nitrogen exists in a range of oxidation states from +5 (nitrate) to -3 (ammonium and amino-nitrogen), and its oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by microbial enzymes determine its environmental fate. The functional annotation of the genes encoding the core nitrogen network enzymes has a broad range of applications in metagenomics, agriculture, wastewater treatment and industrial biotechnology. This study developed an alignment-free computational approach to determine the predicted nitrogen biochemical network-related enzymes from the sequence itself. We propose deepNEC, a novel end-to-end feature selection and classification model training approach for nitrogen biochemical network-related enzyme prediction. The algorithm was developed using Deep Learning, a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input data. The derived protein sequence is used as an input, extracting sequential and convolutional features from raw encoded protein sequences based on classification rather than traditional alignment-based methods for enzyme prediction. Two large datasets of protein sequences, enzymes and non-enzymes were used to train the models with protein sequence features like amino acid composition, dipeptide composition (DPC), conformation transition and distribution, normalized Moreau–Broto (NMBroto), conjoint and quasi order, etc. The k-fold cross-validation and independent testing were performed to validate our model training. deepNEC uses a four-tier approach for prediction; in the first phase, it will predict a query sequence as enzyme or non-enzyme; in the second phase, it will further predict and classify enzymes into nitrogen biochemical network-related enzymes or non-nitrogen metabolism enzymes; in the third phase, it classifies predicted enzymes into nine nitrogen metabolism classes; and in the fourth phase, it predicts the enzyme commission number out of 20 classes for nitrogen metabolism. Among all, the DPC + NMBroto hybrid feature gave the best prediction performance (accuracy of 96.15% in k-fold training and 93.43% in independent testing) with an Matthews correlation coefficient (0.92 training and 0.87 independent testing) in phase I; phase II (accuracy of 99.71% in k-fold training and 98.30% in independent testing); phase III (overall accuracy of 99.03% in k-fold training and 98.98% in independent testing); phase IV (overall accuracy of 99.05% in k-fold training and 98.18% in independent testing), the DPC feature gave the best prediction performance. We have also implemented a homology-based method to remove false negatives.

This review outlines the current research and future directions of the emerging applications of enzymatic technology in the sustainable production and processing of textiles. The state-of-the-art industrial enzymes in textile processing include amylases for desizing of cotton and cellulases for denim-washing and biopolishing. Aside from these established processes, emerging enzymatic processes such as cotton scouring and bleaching, bast fiber retting/degumming, wool scouring and shrink-proofing, silk degumming, bio-dye production and enzyme-assisted dyeing and finishing are at various stages of development. To illustrate the state-of-the-art, representative examples of enzymes in the processing of various types of textile substrates are discussed and evaluated in this article. The major limitations of the large scale implications of textile biotechnology are lack of sufficient research efforts to make it an economically viable option and issues related to technological glitches.

	abstract = {Discovering sugar metabolism genes is of great interest for lignocellulosic biorefinery. Xylose isomerases (XIs) were commonly screened from metagenomes derived from bovine rumen, soil, and other sources. However, so far, XIs and other sugar-utilizing enzymes have not been discovered from fecal metagenomes. In this study, environmental DNA from the fecal samples collected from yellow cattle (Bos taurus) was sequenced and analyzed. In the whole 14.26 Gbp clean data, 92 putative XIs were annotated. After sequence analysis, seven putative XIs were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized in vitro. The XIs 58444 and 58960 purified from E. coli exhibited 22% higher enzyme activity when compared with that of the native E. coli XI. The XI 58444, similar to the XI from Lachnospira multipara, exhibited a relatively stable activity profile across different pH conditions. Four XIs were further investigated in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae after codon optimization. Overexpression of the codon-optimized 58444 enabled S. cerevisiae to utilize 6.4 g/L xylose after 96 h without any other genetic manipulations, which is 56% higher than the control yeast strain overexpressing an optimized XI gene xylA*3 selected by three rounds of mutation. Our results provide evidence that a bovine fecal metagenome is a novel and valuable source of XIs and other industrial enzymes for biotechnology applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The use of residues from the industrial processing of palm oil as carbon source and inducer for microbial lipase production can be a way to add value to such residues and to contribute to reduced enzyme costs. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using palm oil industrial waste as feedstock for lipase production in different cultivation systems. Evaluation was made of lipase production by a selected strain of Aspergillus niger cultivated under solid-state (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF). Lipase activity levels up to 15.41 IU/mL were achieved under SSF. The effects of pH and temperature on the lipase activity of the SSF extract were evaluated using statistical design methodology, and maximum activities were obtained between pH 4.0 and 6.5 and at temperatures between 37 and 55 °C. This lipase presented good thermal stability up to 60 °C and higher specificity towards long carbon chain substrates. The results demonstrate the potential application of palm oil industrial residues for lipase production and contribute to the technological advances needed to develop processes for industrial enzymes production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Lignocellulose is the most abundant biomass on Earth with immense potential to act as a primary resource for the production of a range of compounds currently obtained from fossil fuel sources. However, lignocellulosic feedstocks remain largely underexploited due to the complex mixture of recalcitrant polymers present, whose structural features hinder access to the utilizable monosaccharide reservoir within cellulose. Various fungi and bacteria have been identified that can enzymatically decompose lignocellulose to its monomeric compounds for use as carbon sources. The investigation of such lignocellulolytic organisms has proven very useful in gaining primary insights into degradation processes and key microbial enzymes, but the established limitations of culture-based approaches suggest that we have yet to understand the full range of lignocellulolytic mechanisms, likely expressed within natural systems. In this review, we focus on metagenomic approaches to study lignocellulose degradation from structural and functional perspectives, which may provide novel insights into this process in order to rationally design methods for the extraction of compounds from biomass that could enhance biorefinery efficiencies. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {The agricultural sector in Southeast Asia holds significant importance for the region's economies, playing a vital role in employment and ensuring food security. Major contributors to this sector include Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. In fact, the agricultural sector has contributed to 10–30 % of gross domestic product in most Southeast Asia countries. However, the high demand for agricultural products has led to the generation of excessive biomass, which accounted for approximately 100–200 millions metric tonnes annually, much of which remains unused. In response, there has been a growing trend towards biomass biorefinery, producing value-added products such as bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Several key challenges in utilizing biomass as a feedstock are the high cost of enzymes required for conversion processes, as well as pretreatment required in the agricultural biomass utilization, which hinders commercialization efforts. To address this challenge, leveraging microorganisms for enzyme production using biomass itself has emerged as a promising solution. This review aims to provide the comprehensive potential utilization of major agricultural biomass in Southeast Asia in bioconversion of valuable product, in such enzyme. This work intends to enlighten the potential and feasibilities factors driving the transition from traditional agricultural practices to modern enzymatic production. It delves into fermentation factors and condition, emphasizing the need for sustainable and efficient enzymatic conversion processes to fully exploit the potential of agricultural biomass for industrial applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic ethanol is considered as a good alternative to increase the current amount of first generation ethanol produced, since it does not compete for land with food production. Biochemical technological routes have high potential to be adopted for lignocellulosic ethanol production, in which hydrolysis processes demand cellulase enzymes to convert cellulose and hemicellulose materials into fermentable sugars. Thus, an integral evaluation of lignocellulosic ethanol requires knowledge of the energetic-environmental costs of production of enzymes, which generally occurs off-site of biorefinery plants in specialized companies. The aims of this work are to assess the energetic-environmental costs of cellulase enzyme production and verify their influence on the lignocellulosic ethanol overall cost. For this, the production of industrial enzyme operating under submerged fermentation process was assessed by (i) emergy accounting, (ii) embodied energy analysis, (iii) and emission inventory. Monte Carlo simulation was used for uncertainty analysis. Results show that cellulase enzyme demands 4.06E14seJ/kgenzyme and 1664MJ/kgenzyme with a global warming potential of 21.90kgCO2-eq./kgenzyme. These values are equivalent to 0.41%, 0.49%, and 0.02%, respectively, of the emergy, embodied energy, and global warming potential of lignocellulosic ethanol production, making their contribution to the overall energetic-environmental costs negligible when compared to other input resources of the ethanol production chain such as limestone and diesel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Keratin is an insoluble and protein-rich epidermal material found in e.g. feather, wool, hair. It is produced in substantial amounts as co-product from poultry processing plants and pig slaughterhouses. Keratin is packed by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. Based on the secondary structure, keratin can be classified into α-keratin and β-keratin. Keratinases (EC 3.4.-.- peptide hydrolases) have major potential to degrade keratin for sustainable recycling of the protein and amino acids. Currently, the known keratinolytic enzymes belong to at least 14 different protease families: S1, S8, S9, S10, S16, M3, M4, M14, M16, M28, M32, M36, M38, M55 (MEROPS database). The various keratinolytic enzymes act via endo-attack (proteases in families S1, S8, S16, M4, M16, M36), exo-attack (proteases in families S9, S10, M14, M28, M38, M55) or by action only on oligopeptides (proteases in families M3, M32), respectively. Other enzymes, particularly disulfide reductases, also play a key role in keratin degradation as they catalyze the breakage of disulfide bonds for better keratinase catalysis. This review aims to contribute an overview of keratin biomass as an enzyme substrate and a systematic analysis of currently sequenced keratinolytic enzymes and their classification and reaction mechanisms. We also summarize and discuss keratinase assays, available keratinase structures and finally examine the available data on uses of keratinases in practical biorefinery protein upcycling applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {High-value chemicals and energy-related products can be produced from biomass. Biorefinery technology offers a sustainable and cost-effective method for this high-value conversion. β-glucosidase is one of the key enzymes in biorefinery processes, catalyzing the production of glucose from aryl-glycosides and cello-oligosaccharides via the hydrolysis of β-glycosidic bonds. Although β-glucosidase plays a critical catalytic role in the utilization of cellulosic biomass, its efficacy is often limited by substrate or product inhibitions, low thermostability, and/or insufficient catalytic activity. To provide a detailed overview of β-glucosidases and their benefits in certain desired applications, we collected and summarized extensive information from literature and public databases, covering β-glucosidases in different glycosidase hydrolase families and biological kingdoms. These β-glucosidases show differences in amino acid sequence, which are translated into varying degrees of the molecular properties critical in enzymatic applications. This review describes studies on the diversity of β-glucosidases related to the classification, catalytic mechanisms, key molecular characteristics, kinetics models, and applications, and highlights several β-glucosidases displaying high stability, activity, and resistance to glucose inhibition suitable for desired biotechnological applications. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Onion skins, actually recycled as organic fertilizers, could be used as a substrate in environmental-friendly bioprocesses to recover high-value bioactive compounds and food ingredients. In this work, a bioprospecting method was carried out including 94 bacterial and 45 yeast strains from several agri-food and environmental niches to verify their ability to grow on onion skins as unique nutrients source. Red and yellow onion skins were assessed by newly selected starter-driven liquid submerged fermentation assays mainly aimed at the release and modification of polyphenols through microbial activities. Fermented onion skins were also investigated as a inexpensive favourable source of microbial enzymes (amylases, proteases, lipases, esterases, cellulases, xylanases). In red onion skins, the treatment with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TB 11–32 produced a slight increase of bioactive compounds in terms of total phenolics, whereas with the yeast strain Zygosaccharomyces mrakii CL 30 − 29 the quercetin aglycone content increased of about 25% of the initial raw material. In yellow onion skins inoculated, the highest content of phenolic compounds was detected with the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae En SC, while quercetin aglycone increased of about 60% of the initial raw material in presence of the bacterial strain L. plantarum C 180 − 34. In conclusion, the proposed microbial pre-treatment method can be a potential strategy to re-use onion skins as a fermentation substrate, and as a first step in the development of a biorefinery process to produce value-added products from onion by-products. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are prebiotic oligosaccharides made from xylose monomers linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds and can be obtained by processing lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). Research on XOS is growing rapidly and has received widespread attention. XOS is currently used in food, feed, medicine, and agriculture. This article provides an overview of XOS production strategies, purification methods, applications, and ideas for biorefineries producing XOS and other products. Among them, organic acid catalysis is a promising production strategy with high yields, low by-products, fast reaction rates, and environmental friendliness. Various xylanases, including essential and auxiliary enzymes, have been developed to produce XOS. The use of immobilized enzymes in the enzymatic hydrolysis process will help to reduce the production cost of XOS, and it can enhance the hydrolysis performance of the enzyme to a certain extent; therefore, the development of immobilized enzyme technology is particularly important for the production of XOS by enzymatic hydrolysis. Nowadays, the processing of LCB has evolved towards a more efficient and cleaner direction. There are fewer studies on biorefineries for the production of XOS, and this review also suggests some ideas for the production of biorefineries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Growing fossil raw material demand, especially for producing fuels, has caused serious damage to the environment, mainly in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To minimize non-renewable fuel use and impacts, biomasses can be used as substitutes to achieve a sustainable circular economy, especially in Brazil, which is one of the largest biomass producers in the world. Ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas/biomethane have been extensively studied as alternatives to fossil fuels, the two first being already produced at industrial scales and used as vehicle fuels in Brazil. Additionally, different biomasses have been used as raw materials to produce biofuels, and enzymatic catalysis have shown promising potential to achieve feasible and sustainable processes. Some main enzymes are amylases, which are used extensively in corn starch hydrolysis to produce first generation (1G) ethanol using a well-established process, while cellulases and xylanases are promising in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic materials for producing second generation (2G) ethanol. Lipases, on the other hand, are interesting catalysts for effectively converting triacylglycerols (TAGs), and free fatty acids (FFAs) from several vegetable oils or animal fats into biodiesel.

	abstract = {Sugar alcohols are widely marketed compounds. They are useful building block chemicals and of particular value as low- or non-calorigenic sweeteners, serving as sugar substitutes in the food industry. To date most sugar alcohols are produced by chemical routes using pure sugars, but a transition towards the use of renewable, non-edible feedstocks is anticipated. Several yeasts are naturally able to convert renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic substrates, glycerol and molasses, into sugar alcohols. These bioconversions often face difficulties to obtain sufficiently high yields and productivities necessary for industrialization. This review provides insight into the most recent studies on utilizing yeasts for the conversion of renewable feedstocks to diverse sugar alcohols, including xylitol, erythritol, mannitol and arabitol. Moreover, metabolic approaches are highlighted that specifically target shortcomings of sugar alcohol production by yeasts from these renewable substrates. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The demand for cultured finfish has increased tremendously during the last decades, but the success of intensive farming is dependent on several factors, namely management, dietary supplementations and welfare. During the last decades, increasing demand, high price and limited supply of fishmeal have emphasized the need for alternative protein sources in aquafeeds, but plant proteins possess a series of endogenous antinutritional factors (ANFs; e.g. protease inhibitors, tannin, mimosine, phytic acid, nonstarch polysaccharides), and they must be destroyed or inactivated. Inclusion of alternative protein sources has resulted in production losses and is a concern for farmers. However, the problem with ANFs might be solved using advanced processing techniques. The present review, focusing on tropical and subtropical freshwater finfish, will discuss findings on applications of conventional methods, as well as fermentation technology for deactivation of endogenous ANFs, and the use of probiotics with ANF degrading potential when plant ingredients are included in fish feeds. © 2018 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd},

	abstract = {As a crucial hydrolytic enzyme, urease plays a vital role in anaerobic biological treatment. It is well-known that manganese ions are abundant in landfill leachate, but their concentration fluctuates significantly. However, few studies have investigated the effect and mechanism of different concentrations of Mn2+ on urease activity during anaerobic biological treatment of landfill leachate. This paper aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of different concentrations of Mn2+ on urease activity. The results showed that an appropriate amount of Mn2+ could significantly enhance urease activity, while a high concentration of Mn2+ could inhibit it. Insight into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, various methods such as Zeta potential, particle size, ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and statistical analysis were employed in our study. Research suggested that, on one hand, Mn2+ may form hydrogen bonds with the side chain amino or carboxyl groups of urease amino acid residues, affecting the structure of urease through hydrogen bonding. Additionally, Mn2+ also binds to urease through hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, the C–OH and C-N functional groups in urease have a strong affinity for Mn2+, and changes in these functional groups can greatly enhance the activity of urease. Furthermore, under the action of high concentrations of Mn2+, while the structure of urease becomes more stable, there is also a steric hindrance phenomenon that affects the substrate from entering the catalytic center. Therefore, studying the mechanism of Mn2+ affecting urease activity has significant biological significance and provides a new perspective for exploring the impact of metals on anaerobic bioprocessing of landfill leachate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Pectinases are a diverse group of enzymes that play a crucial role in modifying or breaking down complex pectic substances. Pectinases are widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, and plants. The global demand for microbial pectinase has significantly increased due to its broad applicability and efficient catalytic capabilities across multiple industries including food processing, textiles, and biofuel production. Their commercial production often relies on expensive substrates, contributing to economic inefficiency and environmental burdens. Utilizing agro-industrial waste and microorganisms for pectinase production offers a rational solution to two interconnected challenges: the cost-effectiveness of enzyme production and the environmental impact of waste generation. Moreover, the valorization of waste materials not only contributes to efficient enzyme production but also exemplifies a circular approach by minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable resource efficiency to bioprocessing. This review offers a thorough examination of microbial pectinases, including their production from agro-industrial waste, their various industrial applications, and the current market landscape. It also delves into recent advancements in enzyme development and optimization techniques that have significantly boosted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of pectinase production. By highlighting these developments, the review emphasizes the potential for this approach to enhance industrial practices and contribute to environmental sustainability. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE)},

	abstract = {This paper gives an overview of development of the EU-bioeconomy, 2014–2020. The Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014–2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE. In contrast to fossil resources biological resources are found worldwide. In its outset, circular bio-based economy, can be implemented all over, in a just manner, not the least stimulating rural development. © Copyright © 2021 Lange, Connor, Arason, Bundgård-Jørgensen, Canalis, Carrez, Gallagher, Gøtke, Huyghe, Jarry, Llorente, Marinova, Martins, Mengal, Paiano, Panoutsou, Rodrigues, Stengel, van der Meer and Vieira.},

Updates have already appeared in the literature, including marine examples of oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases, isomerases, ligases, and lyases ready for food and pharmaceutical applications. Here a new approach for searching the literature and presenting a more refined analysis is adopted with respect to previous surveys, centering the attention on the enzymatic process rather than on a single novel activity. Fields of applications are easily individuated: (i) the biorefinery value-chain, where the provision of biomass is one of the most important aspects, with aquaculture as the prominent sector; (ii) the food industry, where the interest in the marine domain is similarly developed to deal with the enzymatic procedures adopted in food manipulation; (iii) the selective and easy extraction/modification of structurally complex marine molecules, where enzymatic treatments are a recognized tool to improve efficiency and selectivity; and (iv) marine biomarkers and derived applications (bioremediation) in pollution monitoring are also included in that these studies could be of high significance for the appreciation of marine bioprocesses. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biotransformation with enzymes and de novo syntheses with whole-cell biocatalysts each have specific advantages. These can be combined to achieve processes with optimal performance. A recent approach is to perform bioconversion processes and enzymatic catalysis simultaneously in one-pot. This is a well-established process in the biorefinery, where starchy or cellulosic material is degraded enzymatically and simultaneously used as substrate for microbial cultivations. This procedure leads to a number of advantages like saving in time but also in the needed equipment (e.g., reaction vessels). In addition, the inhibition or side-reaction of high sugar concentrations can be overcome by combining the processes. These benefits of coupling microbial conversion and enzymatic biotransformation can also be transferred to other processes for example in the sector of biofuel production or in the food industry. However, finding a compromise between the different requirements of the two processes is challenging in some cases. This article summarises the latest developments and process variations.

We describe recent developments in enzyme technology for conversion of cellulose, the most abundant, homogeneous and recalcitrant polysaccharide in lignocellulosic biomass. In particular, we focus on a recently discovered new type of enzymes currently classified as CBM33 and GH61 that catalyze oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides. These enzymes promote the efficiency of classical hydrolytic enzymes (cellulases) by acting on the surfaces of the insoluble substrate, where they introduce chain breaks in the polysaccharide chains, without the need of first extracting these chains from their crystalline matrix. © 2012 Horn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Although the structures of some forms of NHases containing nonheme low spin Fe(III) or low spin noncorrinoid Co(III) are known, neither a catalytic mechanism nor the reasons of high selectivity towards aromatic ligands are recognized. Optimized geometries, molecular electrostatic potential maps and infrared spectra of commercially important aromatic substrates of the NHase (nicotinonitrile, o-, m-, p-methylbenzonitrile) and the corresponding products (nicotinamide, o-, m-, p-methylbenzamid) were investigated using the density functional theory method with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.

	abstract = {Industrial microbiology and industrial biotechnology have enormous versatility involving microbes, mammalian cells plants, and animals. It encompasses the microbial production of primary and secondary metabolites and small and large molecules from plants and animals. Amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, solvents, and organic acids comprise the primary metabolites. Multibillion-dollar markets are involved in the production of amino acids. Fermentative production of vitamins is replacing many synthetic vitamin-production processes. In addition to the multiple reaction sequences of fermentations, microorganisms are extremely useful in carrying out biotransformation processes. Multibillion-dollar markets exist for the medically useful microbial secondary metabolites, i.e., 160 antibiotics and derivatives such as the β-lactam peptide antibiotics, glycopeptides, lipopeptides, polyketides, aminoglycosides, and others. The anti-infective market amounts to 55 billion dollars. Secondary and primary metabolites are of great importance to our health, nutrition, and economics. Enzymatic and cell-based bioconversions are becoming essential to the fine chemical industry, especially for the production of single-isomer intermediates. Microbes also produce hypocholesterolemic agents, enzyme inhibitors, immunosuppressants, and antitumor compounds, some having markets of several billion dollars per year. They also make agriculturally important secondary metabolites such as coccidiostats, animal growth promatants, anthelmintics, and biopesticides. Recombinant DNA technology has served to improve the production of all of the above products. Molecular manipulations have been added to mutational techniques as a means of increasing titers and yields of microbial processes and in discovery of new drugs, but have made a major impact in creating a viable biopharmaceutical industry. This industry has made a fantastic impact in the business world, yielding biopharmaceuticals (recombinant protein drugs, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies) having markets of many billions of dollars. It also produced a revolution in agriculture and has markedly increased the markets for microbial enzymes. Today, microbiology is a major participant in global industry and will be a major player in the new bioenergy industry, hopefully to replace petroleum within the next 50 years.},

Such pollutants as such as lime, sodium sulfide, salt, solvents, synthetic pigments come mainly from desizing, scouring, bleaching and dyeing processes in textile wet processing. In order to overcome the hazards caused by the chemical effluents, use of enzymes as a viable alternative has been resorted to in preparatory dyeing operations such as desizing, scouring, and bleaching treatments. This review focuses on the use of microbial enzymes as an alternate technology to the conventional methods, and highlights the importance of these enzymes in minimizing the pollution load. Environmental pollution has been a major irritant to industrial development. Also in this paper we have discussed the advantages and limitations of bioprocessing techniques in the various textile wet processing such as desizing, scouring, bleaching, biopolishing, bio-singeing and bio-decoloration in the dyeing effluents for cellulosic and non-cellulosic materials.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceutical biotechnology has a long tradition and is rooted in the last century, first exemplified by penicillin and streptomycin as low molecular weight biosynthetic compounds. Today, pharmaceutical biotechnology still has its fundamentals in fermentation and bioprocessing, but the paradigmatic change affected by biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences has led to an updated definition. The biotechnology revolution redrew the research, development, production and even marketing processes of drugs. Powerful new instruments and biotechnology related scientific disciplines (genomics, proteomics) make it possible to examine and exploit the behavior of proteins and molecules. Recombinant DNA(rDNA) technologies (genetic, protein, and metabolic engineering) allow the production of a wide range of peptides, proteins, and biochemicals from naturally nonproducing cells. This technology, now approximately 25 years old, is becoming one of the most important technologies developed in the 20th century. Pharmaceutical products and industrial enzymes were the first biotech products on the world market made by means of rDNA. Despite important advances regarding rDNA applications in mammalian cells, yeasts still represent attractive hosts for the production of heterologous proteins. In this review we describe these processes. Copyright © 2013 by Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {The date palm Phoenix dactylifera has played an important role in the day-to-day life of the people for the last 7000. years. Today worldwide production, utilization and industrialization of dates are continuously increasing since date fruits have earned great importance in human nutrition owing to their rich content of essential nutrients. Tons of date palm fruit wastes are discarded daily by the date processing industries leading to environmental problems. Wastes such as date pits represent an average of 10% of the date fruits. Thus, there is an urgent need to find suitable applications for this waste. In spite of several studies on date palm cultivation, their utilization and scope for utilizing date fruit in therapeutic applications, very few reviews are available and they are limited to the chemistry and pharmacology of the date fruits and phytochemical composition, nutritional significance and potential health benefits of date fruit consumption. In this context, in the present review the prospects of valorization of these date fruit processing by-products and wastes' employing fermentation and enzyme processing technologies towards total utilization of this valuable commodity for the production of biofuels, biopolymers, biosurfactants, organic acids, antibiotics, industrial enzymes and other possible industrial chemicals are discussed. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Information on the nature, trend and quality of biotechnology research, development, applications and management in a country is generally needed to improve policy decisions, guide future research and cooperation, civil society and general public knowledge, technology development agencies and to support public sector implementation of biotechnology research. However, there has been to date no comprehensive publication describing overall biotechnology research and development in Zimbabwe. The little information available only cover agricultural biotechnology in particular plant biotechnology. This paper, therefore, offers a profile of Zimbabwe's overall biotechnology research and development covering activities that provide new knowledge, and the application of biotechnological techniques, biosafety and the regulation status of the biotechnology in the country. The aim is to provide an insight and update of the state of biotechnology in Zimbabwe. This paper also aims to highlight the country's strengths and weaknesses in biotechnology research and development capacity. This information will help scientists, policy makers and regulators and other stakeholders understand the state of biotechnology in the country and serve to guide scientists who are interested in doing research in untapped areas of biotechnology in the country. Currently, Zimbabwe has a sizable number of research groups using biotechnology in a variety of areas. Current projects in agricultural biotechnology are mainly carried out at universities and public research institutes and are aimed at improving disease, herbicide, drought and insect resistance and for plant propagation. Especially plant tissue culture is widely used while work on genetic engineering is being carried in few laboratories. In food and beverages, biotechnological research is focussed on microbiology and biochemical processes and use of starter cultures during fermentation of traditional foods. Zimbabwe is being involved in industrial biotechnology in a limited fashion, through search and use of her biological resources as sources of potential industrial enzymes. Biotechnological researches with environmental relevance include decolouration of textile dyes, wastewater treatment and biogas production from municipal, industrial and agricultural waste (water). It is found that Zimbabwe's biotechnology is mainly traditional and most research organisations are applying less advanced biotechnology techniques. Poor infrastructure, lack of human resources and funding are the major challenges to modern biotechnology development in Zimbabwe, although biotechnology research development and management is more established in the country than in most of the sub-Saharan African countries. Zimbabwe has developed the legal framework to guide research and development of modern biotechnology through its National Biotechnology Authority Act (Act 3, 2006/ Chapter 14:31). However, there is still need to develop a National Biotechnology Strategy if the country is to realise more benefits from biotechnology. © 2009 Academic Journals.},

Based on its wide and unique spectrum of properties, enzymes have been developed for wide applications in various industrial processes. The development of the enzyme catalysed applications is based on the modification of the reaction systems to enhance their catalytic activities. Some of the applications of the industrial enzymes include the fine chemicals production, oleochemicals modification, detergent formulation, enzymatic deinking of waste papers, animal feed formulation and effluent treatment processes. Enzymes have also shown to be successfully used as analytical tool in the determination of compounds in body fluids.

	abstract = {The Bacillaceae family members are a good source of bacteria for bioprocessing and biotransformation involving whole cells or enzymes. In contrast to Bacillus and Geobacillus, Anoxybacillus is a relatively new genus that was proposed in the year 2000. Because these bacteria are alkali-tolerant thermophiles, they are suitable for many industrial applications. More than a decade after the first report of Anoxybacillus, knowledge accumulated from fundamental and applied studies suggests that this genus can serve as a good alternative in many applications related to starch and lignocellulosic biomasses, environmental waste treatment, enzyme technology, and possibly bioenergy production. This current review provides the first summary of past and recent discoveries regarding the isolation of Anoxybacillus, its medium requirements, its proteins that have been characterized and cloned, bioremediation applications, metabolic studies, and genomic analysis. Comparisons to some other members of Bacillaceae and possible future applications of Anoxybacillus are also discussed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Food processing industry operations need to comply with increasingly more stringent environmental regulations related to the disposal or utilisation of by-products and wastes. These include growing restrictions on land spraying with agro-industrial wastes, and on disposal within landfill operations, and the requirements to produce end products that are stabilised and hygienic. Much of the material generated as wastes by the dairy processing industries contains components that could be utilised as substrates and nutrients in a variety of microbial/enzymatic processes, to give rise to added-value products. A good example of a waste that has received considerable attention as a source of added-value products is cheese whey. The carbohydrate reservoir of lactose (4-5%) in whey and the presence of other essential nutrients make it a good natural medium for the growth of microorganisms and a potential substrate for bioprocessing through microbial fermentation. Immobilised cell and enzyme technology has also been applied to whey bioconversion processes to improve the economics of such processes. This review focuses upon the elaboration of a range of immobilisation techniques that have been applied to produce valuable whey-based products. A comprehensive literature survey is also provided to illustrate numerous immobilisation procedures with particular emphasis upon lactose hydrolysis, and ethanol and lactic acid production using immobilised biocatalysts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {One near-term option to developing a forest product biorefinery is to derive pre-pulping extract from incoming wood chips before the main pulping step. The release of monomer sugars from a xylan-rich extract, creating a fermentable substrate is a prerequisite for utilization of pre-pulping extract for production of ethanol or other value-added products. This study examined the individual and mixture efficiencies of two hemicellulolytic microbial enzymes and two xylanase preparations in catalyzing degradation of green liquor (GL) and hot water (HW) pre-pulping extracts. The effects of four commercial enzyme preparations were determined by assessing yields of xylose + galactose + mannose (xmg) obtained under different reaction conditions. Of the individual enzyme preparations tested, a sample NS 50012 was superior to the other enzyme preparations in releasing xmg under conditions optimized for separate hydrolysis and fermentation and for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. In comparison to pre-pulping extracts treated with HW, extract treated with GL was found to inhibit the action of all tested enzymes. This inhibition may be related to higher salt and lignin phenol in the GL extract. On both types of extracts, the mixture constituted by NS 50012 and NS 50030 provided the highest yield of hemicellulose conversion at 55 °C and pH 5.5. The generated digestibility thus signified that the synergistic effectiveness in xylan + galactan + mannan (XMG) hydrolysis between NS 50012 (from Aspergillus aculeatus) and NS 50030 (from Aspergillus oryzae) is the result of an interaction mechanism involving different XMG-degrading enzyme activities in the two enzyme preparations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Advances on enzyme technology have improved the economics of cellulosic ethanol. Nevertheless, there is still great interest to improve the production and the characteristics of the enzymatic preparations. One possibility to reduce the cost of the enzymes is on-site enzyme production in a biorefinery plant, in which part of the lignocellulosic material already available can be used as a cheap carbon source in the enzyme production. Results: Steam exploded wheat straw at two different severity conditions was evaluated as carbon source for enzyme production by Trichoderma reesei. The results showed that volumetric production of cellulases and β-glucosidase increased when using a carbon source with high cellulose content. When a carbon source with a higher content of hemicellulose was used the enzymatic mixture showed significantly higher proportions of hemicellulase activities (xylanase, β-xylosidase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase), which had a positive effect on subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Conclusions: The proportion of cellulose and hemicellulose in the carbon source has an influence on the composition of the enzymatic cocktail. The higher the cellulose and hemicellulose content, the higher the titer of cellulase and hemicellulase produced by the fungus, respectively. The enzyme preparations with higher hemicellulase activities were more efficient in hydrolyzing xylan-containing substrates. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {Background: Proteases constitute the largest product segment in the global industrial enzymes market; they are used in food, pharmaceutical, leather, textile, wood and detergent industries. Alkaline proteases improve the cleaning efficiency of detergents and represent one of the most successful applications of modern industrial biotechnology. The aim of this work was to study the performance of two alkaline phytoproteases, araujiain (Araujia hortorum Fourn.) and asclepain (Asclepias curassavica L.), for their potential application as additive in laundry detergent formulations. Results: The effect of pure non-ionic and ionic surfactants on proteolytic activity of araujiain and asclepain was analyzed measuring the remaining activity after 1 hr of incubation of those enzymes in aqueous solutions of surfactants at different concentrations (0.1, 0.4 and 1% v/v) and temperatures (25, 40 and 60oC). Besides, the compatibility of the enzymes with six commercial laundry detergents was also studied measuring the remaining proteolytic activity at 37oC after 1 hr. Commercial detergent components influenced in different ways on araujiain and asclepain, in spite of the similar behaviour of the two enzymes in buffer. In commercial detergent solutions, araujiain expressed between 60% and 140% of its remaining proteolytic activity in buffer (pH 8.5) at 37oC after 1 hr, while asclepain, was practically inactivate in most of them at the same conditions. Conclusions: Proteolytic extract of Araujia hortorum fulfilled all the requirements for its application as additive for laundry detergents: high stability in a broad temperature range (25-70oC), high activity in alkaline pH (7.5-9.5) and very good compatibility with the commercial detergent additives. Nevertheless, in spite of its high stability and activity in buffer, the proteolytic extract of Asclepias curassavica did not show the same performance than araujiain. © 2013 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile.},

It can allow Americans to live longer, healthier lives, reduce our dependence on oil, address key environmental challenges, transform manufacturing processes, and increase the productivity and scope of the agricultural sector while growing new jobs and industries. Decades of life-sciences research and the development of increasingly powerful tools for obtaining and using biological data have brought us closer to the threshold of a previously unimaginable future: "ready to burn" liquid fuels produced directly from CO 2, biodegradable plastics made not from oil but from renewable biomass, tailored food products to meet specialized dietary requirements, personalized medical treatments based on a patient's own genomic information, and novel biosensors for real-time monitoring of the environment. Increasingly, scientists and engineers are looking to augment biological research with approaches from other scientific disciplines for solutions to our most demanding scientific and societal challenges and seeing exciting options that will profoundly affect our future. Technological innovation is a significant driver of economic growth, and the US bioeconomy represents a growing sector of this technologyfueled economy. Agriculture, one of the country's largest industries, is heavily based on advances in biological research and development (R&D). According to the USDA, US revenues in 2010 from genetically modified crops were approximately $76 billion. Beyond agriculture, based on the best available estimate, 2010USrevenues from industrial biotechnology- fuels, materials, chemicals, and industrial enzymes derived from genetically modified systems were approximately $100 billion. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {The importance and development of industrial biotechnology processing has led to the utilisation of microbial enzymes in various applications. One of the important enzymes is amylase, which hydrolyses starch to glucose. In Malaysia, the use of sago starch has been increasing, and it is presently being used for the production of glucose. Sago starch represents an alternative cheap carbon source for fermentation processes that is attractive out of both economic and geographical considerations. Production of fermentable sugars from the hydrolysis of starches is normally carried out by an enzymatic processes that involves two reaction steps, liquefaction and saccharification, each of which has different temperature and pH optima with respect to the maximum reaction rate. This method of starch hydrolysis requires the use of an expensive temperature control system and a complex mixing device. Our laboratory has investigated the possibility of using amylolytic enzyme-producing microorganisms in the continuous single-step biological hydrolysis of sago flour for the production of a generic fermentation medium. The ability of a novel DNA-recombinated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YKU 107 (expressing α-amylase production) to hydrolyse gelatinised sago starch production has been studied with the aim of further utilizing sago starch to obtain value-added products.},

	abstract = {The use of low cost agro-industrial residues for the production of industrial enzymes is one of the ways to reduce significantly production costs. Cellulase producing actinomycetes were isolated from soil and decayed agricultural wastes. Among them, a potential culture, strain NEAE-J, was selected and identified on the basis of morphological, cultural, physiological and chemotaxonomic properties, together with 16S rDNA sequence. It is proposed that strain NEAE-J should be included in the species Streptomyces albogriseolus as a representative of a novel sub-species, Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus strain NEAE-J and sequencing product was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number JN229412. This organism was tested for its ability to produce endoglucanase and release reducing sugars from agro-industrial residues as substrates. Sugarcane bagasse was the most suitable substrate for endoglucanase production. Effects of process variables, namely incubation time, temperature, initial pH and nitrogen source on production of endoglucanase by submerged fermentation using Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus have been studied. Accordingly optimum conditions have been determined. Incubation temperature of 30 °C after 6 days, pH of 6.5, 1% sugarcane bagasse as carbon source and peptone as nitrogen source were found to be the optimum for endoglucanase production. Optimization of the process parameters resulted in about 2.6 fold increase in the endoglucanase activity. Therefore, Streptomyces albogriseolus subsp. cellulolyticus coud be potential microorganism for the intended application. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia. All Rights Reserved.},

Biotechnological interventions such as biorefinery platforms that produce chemicals and fuels provide opportunities to reconcile the security and environmental sustainability criteria increasingly sought after by governments. Indeed, sustainable and more carbon neutral options have been positively benchmarked against scenarios based solely on petrochemical feedstocks. Notably, biotechnology companies are beginning to use Environmental Management Systems employed by other industries to advocate the benefits of green technologies that employ GM, industrial enzymes and bio-materials. Management systems such as Life Cycle Analysis are providing a powerful means to measure benefits and augment change in the biotechnology sector. These methods are discussed here in the context of the emergent 21st Century debates on security. The evidence presented leads to a conclusion where biotechnologies are likely to offer increasingly high impact options for sustainability and security criteria required for food and fuel supply. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Up to comparatively recently orange peel and the associated residual remnants of membranes resulting from juice extraction represented a significant disposal problem, especially in those regions where orange cultivation is a major industry. However, recent research has demonstrated that orange peel waste represents a potentially valuable resource that can be developed into high value products. These developments are critically reviewed in this article. This includes a summary of the chemical composition of the substrate and an assessment of the range of applications in which the peel is deployed. Utilization as a substrate to produce animal feed, fertilizer, essential oils, pectin, ethanol, methane, industrial enzymes, and single cell protein is discussed. The applications described together with those that will no doubt be developed in the future, represent great opportunities to harness the economical benefit of this agro-industrial waste and to develop even more efficient and sustainable systems.

	abstract = {Microbial bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol still poses challenges in terms of substrate catabolism. A targeted evolution-based study was undertaken to determine if inter-strain microbial variability could be exploited for bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol. The microorganism studied was Fusarium oxysporum because of its capacity to both saccharify and ferment lignocellulose. Strains of F. oxysporum were isolated and assessed for their genetic variability. Using optimised solid-state straw culture conditions, experiments were conducted that compared fungal strains in terms of their growth, enzyme activities (cellulases, xylanase and alcohol dehydrogenase) and yield of bioethanol and the undesirable by-products acetic acid and xylitol. Significant interstrain divergence was recorded in regards to the capacity of studied F. oxysporum strains to produce alcohol from untreated straw. No correlation was observed between bioethanol synthesis and either the biomass production or microbial enzyme activity. A strong correlation was observed between both acetic acid and xylitol production and bioethanol yield. The level of diversity recorded in the alcohol production capacity among closely-related microorganism means that a targeted screening of populations of selected microbial species could greatly improve bioprocessing yields, in terms of providing both new host strains and candidate genes for the bioethanol industry. © 2012 Ali et al.},

	abstract = {Corn fibre contains starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, oil, protein, etc. The separation and the utilisation of its carbohydrate components were studied. A 99.8% of the starch was removed by a two-step enzymtic hydrolysis. The remaining solid fraction was pretreated with alkali (2.5% NaOH) and alkaline peroxide (2.5% NaOH, 0.6% H2O2), in order to isolate corn fibre gum (CFG). The highest yield could be obtained under the most severe conditions (alkaline peroxide, 120°C, 120 min). Following the pretreatment 51.3% of the corn fibre gum could be isolated by alcoholic precipitation from the soluble fraction. The solid fraction was used as carbon source for cellulase enzyme fermentation and as substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis. A 30% higher filter paper activity was obtained using pre-treated corn fibre as carbon source compared to the activities reached on original and destarched corn fibre. However, 15% higher filter paper activities were obtained on Solka Floc than on the pre-treated corn fibre samples. The enzymes produced were used for the hydrolysis of the pre-treated corn fibre substrate. The results of hydrolysis were compared to the performance of industrial enzymes. After 24 h of hydrolysis, the carbohydrate yields showed that the enzyme produced on pre-treated corn fibre could degrade the corn fibre substrate approximately 15% more efficiently. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The present paper encompasses the modeling and optimization approach for production of halophilic, solvent, tolerant, and alkaline lipase from Staphylococcus arlettae through response surface methodology integrated nature inspired genetic algorithm. Response surface model based on central composite design has been developed by considering the individual and interaction effects of fermentation conditions on lipase production through submerged fermentation. The validated input space of response surface model (with R 2 value of 96.6%) has been utilized for optimization through genetic algorithm. An optimum lipase yield of 6.5 U/mL has been obtained using binary coded genetic algorithm predicted conditions of 9.39% inoculum with the oil concentration of 10.285% in 2.99 hrs using pH of 7.32 at 38.8°C. This outcome could contribute to introducing this extremophilic lipase (halophilic, solvent, and tolerant) to industrial biotechnology sector and will be a probable choice for different food, detergent, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.

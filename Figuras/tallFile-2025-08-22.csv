"ABEL AJ, 2022, ENERGY ENVIRON SCI 1","Electromicrobial production (EMP) processes, in which electricity or electrochemically-derived mediator molecules serve as energy sources to drive biochemical processes, represent an attractive strategy for the conversion of CO2 into carbon-based products. However, these systems have yet to be employed on an industrial scale, limiting our understanding of their potential performance and environmental benefits/impacts. We describe the development and application of a comprehensive framework to analyze EMP systems relying on reactor, process, and life cycle impact models. This framework is used to analyze three proposed EMP systems relying on formate, H2, and acetate as intermediate molecules, each producing three hypothetical products: biomass, lactic acid, and industrial enzymes. Physics-based bioreactor models predict that EMP systems can achieve productivities up to 0.65 g L−1 h−1 for biomass production and 0.42 g L−1 h−1 for the production of lactic acid. Despite improved solubility of formate as a substrate, formate-fed EMP systems do not lead to improved productivities compared to H2-fed systems due to O2 gas-liquid mass transfer limitations (for biomass and enzymes) or salinity-induced toxicity issues (for lactic acid). Process models revealed that substrate generation was by far the largest energy demand of the EMP systems, followed by carbon capture and ammonia production, while energy required for gas-liquid mass transfer and fluid mixing accounted for only a small fraction of the systems’ energy footprints. Life cycle impact model results demonstrated that EMP systems can achieve a smaller carbon footprint than traditional bioprocessing strategies provided the electric grid supplying electricity to the EMP system is composed of at least 90% renewable energy sources. For each of the three products we consider, the H2-mediated Knallgas bacteria system achieves the lowest overall global warming potential, indicating that this EMP strategy may be best-suited for industrial efforts based on current technology. EMP systems also would use ∼95% less land compared to traditional bioprocesses. We also identify environmental hotspots and process limitations that are key targets for future engineering and research efforts for each EMP system.

"AGOSTINHO F, 2015, ECOL MODEL","Lignocellulosic ethanol is considered as a good alternative to increase the current amount of first generation ethanol produced, since it does not compete for land with food production. Biochemical technological routes have high potential to be adopted for lignocellulosic ethanol production, in which hydrolysis processes demand cellulase enzymes to convert cellulose and hemicellulose materials into fermentable sugars. Thus, an integral evaluation of lignocellulosic ethanol requires knowledge of the energetic-environmental costs of production of enzymes, which generally occurs off-site of biorefinery plants in specialized companies. The aims of this work are to assess the energetic-environmental costs of cellulase enzyme production and verify their influence on the lignocellulosic ethanol overall cost. For this, the production of industrial enzyme operating under submerged fermentation process was assessed by (i) emergy accounting, (ii) embodied energy analysis, (iii) and emission inventory. Monte Carlo simulation was used for uncertainty analysis. Results show that cellulase enzyme demands 4.06E14seJ/kgenzyme and 1664MJ/kgenzyme with a global warming potential of 21.90kgCO2-eq./kgenzyme. These values are equivalent to 0.41%, 0.49%, and 0.02%, respectively, of the emergy, embodied energy, and global warming potential of lignocellulosic ethanol production, making their contribution to the overall energetic-environmental costs negligible when compared to other input resources of the ethanol production chain such as limestone and diesel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Influence of cellulase enzyme production on the energetic-environmental performance of lignocellulosic ethanol","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.09.005","ENGLISH"

"ALI SS, 2012, AMB EXPRESS","Microbial bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol still poses challenges in terms of substrate catabolism. A targeted evolution-based study was undertaken to determine if inter-strain microbial variability could be exploited for bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol. The microorganism studied was Fusarium oxysporum because of its capacity to both saccharify and ferment lignocellulose. Strains of F. oxysporum were isolated and assessed for their genetic variability. Using optimised solid-state straw culture conditions, experiments were conducted that compared fungal strains in terms of their growth, enzyme activities (cellulases, xylanase and alcohol dehydrogenase) and yield of bioethanol and the undesirable by-products acetic acid and xylitol. Significant interstrain divergence was recorded in regards to the capacity of studied F. oxysporum strains to produce alcohol from untreated straw. No correlation was observed between bioethanol synthesis and either the biomass production or microbial enzyme activity. A strong correlation was observed between both acetic acid and xylitol production and bioethanol yield. The level of diversity recorded in the alcohol production capacity among closely-related microorganism means that a targeted screening of populations of selected microbial species could greatly improve bioprocessing yields, in terms of providing both new host strains and candidate genes for the bioethanol industry. © 2012 Ali et al.","Exploiting the inter-strain divergence of Fusarium oxysporum for microbial bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol","10.1186/2191-0855-2-16","ENGLISH"

Nevertheless, there is still great interest to improve the production and the characteristics of the enzymatic preparations. One possibility to reduce the cost of the enzymes is on-site enzyme production in a biorefinery plant, in which part of the lignocellulosic material already available can be used as a cheap carbon source in the enzyme production. Results: Steam exploded wheat straw at two different severity conditions was evaluated as carbon source for enzyme production by Trichoderma reesei. The results showed that volumetric production of cellulases and β-glucosidase increased when using a carbon source with high cellulose content. When a carbon source with a higher content of hemicellulose was used the enzymatic mixture showed significantly higher proportions of hemicellulase activities (xylanase, β-xylosidase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase), which had a positive effect on subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Conclusions: The proportion of cellulose and hemicellulose in the carbon source has an influence on the composition of the enzymatic cocktail.

"ARORA R, 2024, PROCESS","The production of cellulosic sugars in lignocellulose biorefinery presents significant economic and environmental challenges due to the recalcitrant nature of biomass. The economic and facile production of renewable sugars with high yield and productivity is pivotal for the success of biorefinery. The cellulosic sugars are valorized either by biochemical routes or chemical routes or by hybrid (biological and chemical) routes into renewable chemicals, fuels, and materials. This manuscript focuses on the critical parameters affecting the economic viability of cellulosic sugar production at large scale, including biomass-specific pretreatment strategies and enzyme cost efficiency. High pretreatment costs, carbohydrate loss, and inhibitors production during pretreatment are identified as major contributors to overall production costs. To address these issues, we highlight the importance of developing cost-effective and efficient pretreatment methods tailored to specific biomass types and strategies for enzyme reuse and recycling. Future research should focus on innovations in pretreatment technologies, improved logistics for high-density feedstocks, biomass feeding systems, and advancements in enzyme technology to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of lignocellulosic biorefineries.

This manuscript focuses on the critical parameters affecting the economic viability of cellulosic sugar production at large scale, including biomass-specific pretreatment strategies and enzyme cost efficiency. High pretreatment costs, carbohydrate loss, and inhibitors production during pretreatment are identified as major contributors to overall production costs. To address these issues, we highlight the importance of developing cost-effective and efficient pretreatment methods tailored to specific biomass types and strategies for enzyme reuse and recycling. Future research should focus on innovations in pretreatment technologies, improved logistics for high-density feedstocks, biomass feeding systems, and advancements in enzyme technology to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of lignocellulosic biorefineries. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation and optimization to make the commercial-scale production of cellulosic sugars more viable and sustainable.","Key Takeaways on the Cost-Effective Production of Cellulosic Sugars at Large Scale","10.3390/pr12071496","ENGLISH"
"ASIRI M, 2023, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON","Cellulases are the one of the most highly demanded industrial biocatalysts due to their versatile applications, such as in the biorefinery industry. However, relatively poor efficiency and high production costs are included as the key industrial constraints that hinder enzyme production and utilization at economic scale. Furthermore, the production and functional efficiency of the β-glucosidase (BGL) enzyme is usually found to be relatively low among the cellulase cocktail produced. Thus, the current study focuses on fungi-mediated improvement of BGL enzyme in the presence of a rice straw-derived graphene-silica-based nanocomposite (GSNCs), which has been characterized using various techniques to analyze its physicochemical properties. Under optimized conditions of solid-state fermentation (SSF), co-fermentation using co-cultured cellulolytic enzyme has been done, and maximum enzyme production of 42 IU/gds FP, 142 IU/gds BGL, and 103 IU/gds EG have been achieved at a 5 mg concentration of GSNCs. Moreover, at a 2.5 mg concentration of nanocatalyst, the BGL enzyme showed its thermal stability at 60°C and 70 °C by holding its half-life relative activity for 7 h, while the same enzyme demonstrated pH stability at pH 8.0 and 9.0 for the 10 h. This thermoalkali BGL enzyme might be useful for the long-term bioconversion of cellulosic biomass into sugar. © 2023","Rice straw derived graphene-silica based nanocomposite and its application in improved co-fermentative microbial enzyme production and functional stability","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162765","ENGLISH"
"ASMAT S, 2018, NEW J CHEM 1","Enzymatic biocatalysis has a vast reputation on an industrial scale. The major hindrance faced by enzymes is their denaturation under various conditions. In this study, we report that the activity and stability of enzymes can be enhanced by their immobilization on a novel synthesized polypyrrole-methyl anthranilate-titanium oxide nanocomposite containing amine groups. We demonstrated this by successfully immobilizing lipase from Rhizopus oryzae on a Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC by physical adsorption and a glutaraldehyde-activated covalent coupling procedure. The catalytic efficiencies of the free and immobilized preparations were determined for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate. The covalently immobilized lipase displayed a significantly higher activity yield (effectiveness factor of 0.97) in comparison with the adsorbed counterpart (effectiveness factor of 0.86). The binding of lipase to the Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. TGA and DTA were performed to investigate the thermal stability of the synthesised biocatalysts. The storage stability, solvent tolerance, and reusability of the resulting nanobiocatalyst and the effect of pH and temperature on its catalytic activities were also investigated. The prepared nanobiocatalysts displayed remarkably improved activity in terms of solvent tolerance (activity recovery of 150% and 125% in acetone and isopropanol, respectively) in comparison with its free counterpart. We envisage that the covalent binding method played a profound role in enhancing the properties of the enzyme immobilized on the Ppy-MA/TiO2 NC. In view of the abovementioned results, a hydrolytic enzyme immobilized on this functionalized TiO2 nanocarrier can be used as a stable and effective nanobiocatalyst with vital implications for industrial biotechnology. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.","A polypyrrole-methyl anthranilate functionalized worm-like titanium dioxide nanocomposite as an innovative tool for immobilization of lipase: Preparation, activity, stability and molecular docking investigations","10.1039/c7nj02951a","ENGLISH"

Alkaline proteases improve the cleaning efficiency of detergents and represent one of the most successful applications of modern industrial biotechnology. The aim of this work was to study the performance of two alkaline phytoproteases, araujiain (Araujia hortorum Fourn.) and asclepain (Asclepias curassavica L.), for their potential application as additive in laundry detergent formulations. Results: The effect of pure non-ionic and ionic surfactants on proteolytic activity of araujiain and asclepain was analyzed measuring the remaining activity after 1 hr of incubation of those enzymes in aqueous solutions of surfactants at different concentrations (0.1, 0.4 and 1% v/v) and temperatures (25, 40 and 60oC). Besides, the compatibility of the enzymes with six commercial laundry detergents was also studied measuring the remaining proteolytic activity at 37oC after 1 hr. Commercial detergent components influenced in different ways on araujiain and asclepain, in spite of the similar behaviour of the two enzymes in buffer. In commercial detergent solutions, araujiain expressed between 60% and 140% of its remaining proteolytic activity in buffer (pH 8.5) at 37oC after 1 hr, while asclepain, was practically inactivate in most of them at the same conditions. Conclusions: Proteolytic extract of Araujia hortorum fulfilled all the requirements for its application as additive for laundry detergents: high stability in a broad temperature range (25-70oC), high activity in alkaline pH (7.5-9.5) and very good compatibility with the commercial detergent additives.

Optimization of physical and environmental parameters, along with the screening and optimization of media components, led to an upscaled process in a novel 6-L solid-state fermentation (SSF)-packed bed reactor (PBR) with a substrate loading of 200 g. Saturated forced aeration proved crucial, resulting in high fungal biomass (31.15 ± 0.63 mg glucosamine/gm dry fermented substrate) and high yield cellulase (20.64 ± 0.36 FPU/g-ds) and xylanase (16,186 ± 912 IU/g-ds) production at an optimal airflow rate of 0.75 LPM. The PBR exhibited higher productivity than shake flasks for all the enzyme systems.

However, many questions on the molecular basis of enzyme function and stability remain unanswered. In this work, high-resolution structures of PpDyP wild-type and two engineered variants (6E10 and 29E4) generated by directed evolution were obtained. The X-ray crystal structures revealed the typical ferredoxin-like folds, with three heme access pathways, two tunnels, and one cavity, limited by three long loops including catalytic residues. Variant 6E10 displays significantly increased loops' flexibility that favors function over stability: despite the considerably higher catalytic efficiency, this variant shows poorer protein stability compared to wild-type and 29E4 variants. Constant-pH MD simulations revealed a more positively charged microenvironment near the heme pocket of variant 6E10, particularly in the neutral to alkaline pH range. This microenvironment affects enzyme activity by modulating the pK(a) of essential residues in the heme vicinity and should account for variant 6E10 improved activity at pH 7-8 compared to the wild-type and 29E4 that show optimal enzymatic activity close to pH 4. Our findings shed light on the structure-function relationships of DyPs at the molecular level, including their pH-dependent conformational plasticity. These are essential for understanding and engineering the catalytic properties of DyPs for future biotechnological applications. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The X-ray crystal structures revealed the typical ferredoxin-like folds, with three heme access pathways, two tunnels, and one cavity, limited by three long loops including catalytic residues. Variant 6E10 displays significantly increased loops' flexibility that favors function over stability: despite the considerably higher catalytic efficiency, this variant shows poorer protein stability compared to wild-type and 29E4 variants. Constant-pH MD simulations revealed a more positively charged microenvironment near the heme pocket of variant 6E10, particularly in the neutral to alkaline pH range. This microenvironment affects enzyme activity by modulating the pK (a) of essential residues in the heme vicinity and should account for variant 6E10 improved activity at pH 7-8 compared to the wild-type and 29E4 that show optimal enzymatic activity close to pH 4. Our findings shed light on the structure-function relationships of DyPs at the molecular level, including their pH-dependent conformational plasticity.

"CARR CM, 2020, FRONT MICROBIOL","Plastic has rapidly transformed our world, with many aspects of human life now relying on a variety of plastic materials. Biological plastic degradation, which employs microorganisms and their degradative enzymes, has emerged as one way to address the unforeseen consequences of the waste streams that have resulted from mass plastic production. The focus of this review is microbial hydrolase enzymes which have been found to act on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. The best characterized examples are discussed together with the use of genomic and protein engineering technologies to obtain PET hydrolase enzymes for different applications. In addition, the obstacles which are currently limiting the development of efficient PET bioprocessing are presented. By continuing to study the possible mechanisms and the structural elements of key enzymes involved in microbial PET hydrolysis, and by assessing the ability of PET hydrolase enzymes to work under practical conditions, this research will help inform large-scale waste management operations. Finally, the contribution of microbial PET hydrolases in creating a potential circular PET economy will be explored. This review combines the current knowledge on enzymatic PET processing with proposed strategies for optimization and use, to help clarify the next steps in addressing pollution by PET and other plastics. © Copyright © 2020 Carr, Clarke and Dobson.","Microbial Polyethylene Terephthalate Hydrolases: Current and Future Perspectives","10.3389/fmicb.2020.571265","ENGLISH"

Industrial strains have traditionally been created though systematic strain improvement using mutagenesis and screening approaches. It is also desirable to specifically manipulate the genes of the organism to further improve and to modify the strain. Targeted integration in filamentous fungi is typically hampered by very low frequencies of homologous recombination. To address this limitation, we have developed a simple transient method for silencing genes in T. reesei Using gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to mus53, we could achieve up to 90% knockdown of mus53 mRNA. As a practical example, we demonstrated that transient silencing of DNA repair genes significantly improved homologous integration of DNA at a specific locus in a standard protoplast transformation.

However, the commercial availability of GE is limited, which hinders the research of GE-based bioprocesses for its industrial application in lignocellulose biorefineries. This study evaluated a workable, cost-effective, and commercially scalable production strategy to improve the ease of GE-based research. This strategy consisted of a constitutive and methanol-free enzyme production step coupled with a two-step filtration process. The aim was to determine if this strategy can yield copious amounts of GE, by secretion into the extracellular medium with an acceptable purity that could allow its direct application. This approach was further validated for cellobiose dehydrogenase, another emerging lignocellulose degrading enzyme which is scarcely available at high cost. RESULTS: The secreted recombinant enzymes were functionally produced in excess of levels previously reported for constitutive production (1489-2780 mg L(-1)), and were secreted at moderate to high percentages of the total extracellular protein (51-94%). The constant glycerol feed, implemented during fed-batch fermentation, lead to a decline in growth rate and plateaued productivity.

"DASHORA K, 2022, CELL MOL LIFE SCI 3","Lignocellulosic materials form the building block of 50\% of plant biomass comprising non-chewable agri-components like wheat straw, rice stubbles, wood shavings and other crop residues. The degradation of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose is complicated and presently being done by chemical process for industrial application through a very energy intensive process. Lignin degradation is primarily an oxidative process where the enzyme lignin peroxidase digests the polymer into smaller fragments. Being a recalcitrant component, higher lignin content poses a challenge of lower recovery of product for industrial use. Globally, the scientists are working on leveraging fungal biotechnology for using the lignocellulose degrading enzymes secreted by actinomycetes and basidiomycetes fungal groups. Enzymes contributing to degradation of lignin are mainly performing the function of modifying the lignin and degrading the lignin. Ligninolytic enzymes do not act as an independent reaction but are vital to complete the degradation process. Microbial enzyme technology is an emerging green tool in industrial biotechnology for commercial application.

"DAVIS KM, 2016, ENERGIES 1","Lignin is a substantial component of lignocellulosic biomass but is under-utilized relative to the cellulose and hemicellulose components. Historically, lignin has been burned as a source of process heat, but this heat is usually in excess of the process energy demands. Current models indicate that development of an economically competitive biorefinery system requires adding value to lignin beyond process heat. This addition of value, also known as lignin valorization, requires economically viable processes for separating the lignin from the other biomass components, depolymerizing the lignin into monomeric subunits, and then upgrading these monomers to a value-added product. The fact that lignin's biological role is to provide biomass with structural integrity means that this heteropolymer can be difficult to depolymerize. However, there are chemical and biological routes to upgrade lignin from its native form to compounds of industrial value. Here we review the historical background and current technology of (thermo) chemical depolymerization of lignin; the natural ability of microbial enzymes and pathways to utilize lignin, the current prospecting work to find novel microbial routes to lignin degradation, and some applications of these microbial enzymes and pathways; and the current chemical and biological technologies to upgrade lignin-derived monomers. © 2016 by the authors.","Recovery and utilization of lignin monomers as part of the biorefinery approach","10.3390/en9100808","ENGLISH"

"DE ASSIS MA, 2024, J FUNGI","Trichoderma erinaceum is a filamentous fungus that was isolated from decaying sugarcane straw at a Brazilian ethanol biorefinery. This fungus shows potential as a source of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs). In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multiomics investigation of T. erinaceum to gain insights into its enzymatic capabilities and genetic makeup. Firstly, we performed genome sequencing and assembly, which resulted in the identification of 10,942 genes in the T. erinaceum genome. We then conducted transcriptomics and secretome analyses to map the gene expression patterns and identify the enzymes produced by T. erinaceum in the presence of different substrates such as glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, pretreated sugarcane straw, and pretreated energy cane bagasse. Our analyses revealed that T. erinaceum highly expresses genes directly related to lignocellulose degradation when grown on pretreated energy cane and sugarcane substrates. Furthermore, our secretome analysis identified 35 carbohydrate-active enzymes, primarily PCWDEs. To further explore the enzymatic capabilities of T. erinaceum, we selected a beta-glucosidase from the secretome data for recombinant production in a fungal strain. The recombinant enzyme demonstrated superior performance in degrading cellobiose and laminaribiose compared to a well-known enzyme derived from Trichoderma reesei. Overall, this comprehensive study provides valuable insights into both the genetic patterns of T. erinaceum and its potential for lignocellulose degradation and enzyme production. The obtained genomic data can serve as an important resource for future genetic engineering efforts aimed at optimizing enzyme production from this fungus.","A Multiomics Perspective on Plant Cell Wall-Degrading Enzyme Production: Insights from the Unexploited Fungus Trichoderma erinaceum","10.3390/jof10060407","ENGLISH"

"DEMAIN AL, 2007, IND BIOTECHNOL","Industrial microbiology and industrial biotechnology have enormous versatility involving microbes, mammalian cells plants, and animals. It encompasses the microbial production of primary and secondary metabolites and small and large molecules from plants and animals. Amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, solvents, and organic acids comprise the primary metabolites. Multibillion-dollar markets are involved in the production of amino acids. Fermentative production of vitamins is replacing many synthetic vitamin-production processes. In addition to the multiple reaction sequences of fermentations, microorganisms are extremely useful in carrying out biotransformation processes. Multibillion-dollar markets exist for the medically useful microbial secondary metabolites, i.e., 160 antibiotics and derivatives such as the β-lactam peptide antibiotics, glycopeptides, lipopeptides, polyketides, aminoglycosides, and others. The anti-infective market amounts to 55 billion dollars. Secondary and primary metabolites are of great importance to our health, nutrition, and economics. Enzymatic and cell-based bioconversions are becoming essential to the fine chemical industry, especially for the production of single-isomer intermediates. Microbes also produce hypocholesterolemic agents, enzyme inhibitors, immunosuppressants, and antitumor compounds, some having markets of several billion dollars per year. They also make agriculturally important secondary metabolites such as coccidiostats, animal growth promatants, anthelmintics, and biopesticides. Recombinant DNA technology has served to improve the production of all of the above products. Molecular manipulations have been added to mutational techniques as a means of increasing titers and yields of microbial processes and in discovery of new drugs, but have made a major impact in creating a viable biopharmaceutical industry. This industry has made a fantastic impact in the business world, yielding biopharmaceuticals (recombinant protein drugs, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies) having markets of many billions of dollars. It also produced a revolution in agriculture and has markedly increased the markets for microbial enzymes. Today, microbiology is a major participant in global industry and will be a major player in the new bioenergy industry, hopefully to replace petroleum within the next 50 years.","The business of biotechnology","10.1089/ind.2007.3.269","ENGLISH"

"FRANDSEN KEH, 2021, J BIOL CHEM","Understanding enzymatic breakdown of plant biomass is crucial to develop nature-inspired biotechnological processes. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are microbial enzymes secreted by fungal saprotrophs involved in carbon recycling. LPMOs modify biomass by oxidatively cleaving polysaccharides, thereby enhancing the efficiency of glycoside hydrolases. Fungal AA9 LPMOs are active on cellulose, but some members also display activity on hemicelluloses and/or oligosaccharides. Although the active site subsites are well defined for a few model LPMOs, the molecular determinants driving broad substrate specificity are still not easily predictable. Based on bioinformatic clustering and sequence alignments, we selected seven fungal AA9 LPMOs that differ in the amino-acid residues constituting their subsites. Investigation of their substrate specificities revealed that all these LPMOs are active on cellulose and cello-oligosaccharides, as well as plant cell wall-derived hemicellulosic polysaccharides, and carry out C4 oxidative cleavage. The product profiles from cello-oligosaccharide degradation suggest that the subtle differences in amino-acid sequence within the substrate-binding loop regions lead to different preferred binding modes. Our functional analyses allowed us to probe the molecular determinants of substrate binding within two AA9 LPMO subclusters. Many wood-degrading fungal species rich in AA9 genes have at least one AA9 enzyme with structural loop features that allow recognition of short β-(1,4)-linked glucan chains. Time-course monitoring of these AA9 LPMOs on cello-oligosaccharides also provides a useful model system for mechanistic studies of LPMO catalysis. These results are valuable for the understanding of LPMO contribution to wood decaying process in nature and for the development of sustainable biorefineries.","Identification of the molecular determinants driving the substrate specificity of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs).","S0021-9258(20)00074-5","ENG"

The search for novel microorganisms for the fermentation of S. baicalensis roots to improve the yields of baicalein and wogonin is of great interest in the food and nutraceutical industries. In this study, a novel endophytic fungus (Penicillium rubens) capable of producing cellulase (0.82 ± 0.12 U/mL) and β-glucosidase (4.55 ± 0.97 U/mL) was used to ferment S. baicalensis roots to obtain high yields of baicalein and wogonin. Semi-solid-state fermentation with homogeneous fungal cultures was found to be the appropriate strategy. Under the optimal fermentation parameters (temperature 30 °C, inoculation dose of fungal cultures 4 mL/g, and time 60 h), the yields of baicalein and wogonin (46.95 ± 4.98 mg/g DW and 31.41 ± 9.36 mg/g DW) from S. baicalensis roots were tremendously increased by 16.13-fold and 15.47-fold over control, respectively. Results of industrial enzyme bioprocessing and scanning electron microscope indicated that the remarkable increase in aglycone product yields could be due to the synergistic effects of cellulase and β-glucosidase produced by P. rubens on cell wall hydrolysis and glycoside deglycosylation.

The phenolic polymer lignin is the second most abundant constituent of this biomass resource and has been shown to have the potential to be converted into industrially important aromatic chemicals after degradation. However, due to its chemical and structural nature, it exhibits high resistance toward mechanical, chemical, and biological degradation, and this causes a major obstacle for achieving efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. In nature, lignin-degrading microorganisms have evolved unique extracellular enzyme systems to decompose lignin using radical mediated oxidative reactions. These microorganisms produce a set of different combinations of enzymes with multiple isozymes and isoforms by responding to various environmental stimuli such as nutrient availability, oxygen concentration and temperature, which are thought to enable effective decomposition of the lignin in lignocellulosic biomass.

"GARCÍA-CALVO L, 2018, J PROTEOMICS","Lignocellulosic plant biomass is the most abundant carbon source in the planet, which makes it a potential substrate for biorefinery. It consists of polysaccharides and other molecules with applications in pharmaceutical, food and feed, cosmetics, paper and textile industries. The exploitation of these resources requires the hydrolysis of the plant cell wall, which is a complex process. Aiming to discover novel fungal natural isolates with lignocellulolytic capacities, a screening for feruloyl esterase activity was performed in samples taken from different metal surfaces. An extracellular enzyme extract from the most promising candidate, the natural isolate Alternaria alternata PDA1, was analyzed. The feruloyl esterase activity of the enzyme extract was characterized, determining the pH and temperature optima (pH 5.0 and 55–60 °C, respectively), thermal stability and kinetic parameters, among others. Proteomic analyses derived from two-dimensional gels allowed the identification and classification of 97 protein spots from the extracellular proteome. Most of the identified proteins belonged to the carbohydrates metabolism group, particularly plant cell wall degradation. Enzymatic activities of the identified proteins (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, β-xylosidase and xylanase) of the extract were also measured. These findings confirm A. alternata PDA1 as a promising lignocellulolytic enzyme producer. Significance: Although plant biomass is an abundant material that can be potentially utilized by several industries, the effective hydrolysis of the recalcitrant plant cell wall is not a straightforward process. As this hydrolysis occurs in nature relying almost solely on microbial enzymatic systems, it is reasonable to infer that further studies on lignocellulolytic enzymes will discover new sustainable industrial solutions. The results included in this paper provide a promising fungal candidate for biotechnological processes to obtain added value from plant byproducts and analogous substrates. Moreover, the proteomic analysis of the secretome of a natural isolate of Alternaria sp. grown in the presence of one of the most used vegetal substrates on the biofuels industry (sugar beet pulp) sheds light on the extracellular enzymatic machinery of this fungal plant pathogen, and can be potentially applied to developing new industrial enzymatic tools. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to analyze in depth the secreted enzyme extract of the plant pathogen Alternaria when grown on a lignocellulosic substrate, identifying its proteins by means of MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and characterizing its feruloyl esterase, cellulase and xylanolytic activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Secreted protein extract analyses present the plant pathogen Alternaria alternata as a suitable industrial enzyme toolbox","10.1016/j.jprot.2018.02.012","ENGLISH"

The highest yield could be obtained under the most severe conditions (alkaline peroxide, 120°C, 120 min). Following the pretreatment 51.3% of the corn fibre gum could be isolated by alcoholic precipitation from the soluble fraction. The solid fraction was used as carbon source for cellulase enzyme fermentation and as substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis. A 30% higher filter paper activity was obtained using pre-treated corn fibre as carbon source compared to the activities reached on original and destarched corn fibre. However, 15% higher filter paper activities were obtained on Solka Floc than on the pre-treated corn fibre samples. The enzymes produced were used for the hydrolysis of the pre-treated corn fibre substrate. The results of hydrolysis were compared to the performance of industrial enzymes.

In this article, main characteristics of this enzyme as well as its action on bulk lignin coming from an industrial process are demonstrated. Lignin modification by MetZyme (R) LIGNO (TM) was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering for monitoring particle size of solubilized lignin.

Major contributors to this sector include Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. In fact, the agricultural sector has contributed to 10-30 \% of gross domestic product in most Southeast Asia countries. However, the high demand for agricultural products has led to the generation of excessive biomass, which accounted for approximately 100-200 millions metric tonnes annually, much of which remains unused. In response, there has been a growing trend towards biomass biorefinery, producing value-added products such as bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Several key challenges in utilizing biomass as a feedstock are the high cost of enzymes required for conversion processes, as well as pretreatment required in the agricultural biomass utilization, which hinders commercialization efforts. To address this challenge, leveraging microorganisms for enzyme production using biomass itself has emerged as a promising solution. This review aims to provide the comprehensive potential utilization of major agricultural biomass in Southeast Asia in bioconversion of valuable product, in such enzyme. This work intends to enlighten the potential and feasibilities factors driving the transition from traditional agricultural practices to modern enzymatic production.

In fact, the agricultural sector has contributed to 10–30 % of gross domestic product in most Southeast Asia countries. However, the high demand for agricultural products has led to the generation of excessive biomass, which accounted for approximately 100–200 millions metric tonnes annually, much of which remains unused. In response, there has been a growing trend towards biomass biorefinery, producing value-added products such as bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Several key challenges in utilizing biomass as a feedstock are the high cost of enzymes required for conversion processes, as well as pretreatment required in the agricultural biomass utilization, which hinders commercialization efforts. To address this challenge, leveraging microorganisms for enzyme production using biomass itself has emerged as a promising solution. This review aims to provide the comprehensive potential utilization of major agricultural biomass in Southeast Asia in bioconversion of valuable product, in such enzyme. This work intends to enlighten the potential and feasibilities factors driving the transition from traditional agricultural practices to modern enzymatic production. It delves into fermentation factors and condition, emphasizing the need for sustainable and efficient enzymatic conversion processes to fully exploit the potential of agricultural biomass for industrial applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Feasibility of agricultural biomass in Southeast Asia for enzymes production","10.1016/j.rser.2024.114601","ENGLISH"

It represents as one of the third largest group of industrial enzyme and finds its applications in detergents, leather industry, pharmaceutical industry etc. Among the different vegetable waste products, peel of Manihot esculenta (Tapioca/cassava) was used as substrates for the production of protease by Bacillus sp. The aim of our study is to utilize the waste of Tapioca peel as input for protease production using Bacillus sp. The protease produced by Bacillus sp from M. esculenta showed a pH of 10 and temperature of about 30°C. Protease produced was tested for possible industrial applications. This enzyme shows high capacity in removing the blood stain, dehairing the animal skin, digestion of natural proteins and bioprocessing of used X-ray film. The wash performance analysis of blood stains on cotton fabrics showed that blood stains were completely removed within 15 minutes of incubation of fabrics along with enzyme. Complete hair removal of goat skin by the protease achieved within 12 hours of incubation at 30°C. This enzyme has the ability to dissolve the blood clot and coagulated egg within 20 minutes of incubation. Enymatic hydrolysis of gelatin from waste X-ray films was also investigated. At the end of the treatment, gelatin layer was completely removed leaving the polyester film clean. Gelatin hydrolysis was monitored by measuring increase in turbidity. Gelatin layer was removed completely within 10 minutes of addition of enzyme. The protease produced exhibits high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study was a humble attempt towards the production of protease and to check their efficiency in industrial applications. These properties indicate the possibilities of enzyme usage in various industries and it can be exploited commercially in future.","An inexpensive substrate for the production of alkaline protease by Bacillus sp and its application studies of Manihot esculenta",NA,"ENGLISH"
"KAUL K, 2024, FOOD BIOPROD PROCESS","Pectinases are a diverse group of enzymes that play a crucial role in modifying or breaking down complex pectic substances. Pectinases are widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, and plants. The global demand for microbial pectinase has significantly increased due to its broad applicability and efficient catalytic capabilities across multiple industries including food processing, textiles, and biofuel production. Their commercial production often relies on expensive substrates, contributing to economic inefficiency and environmental burdens. Utilizing agro-industrial waste and microorganisms for pectinase production offers a rational solution to two interconnected challenges: the cost-effectiveness of enzyme production and the environmental impact of waste generation. Moreover, the valorization of waste materials not only contributes to efficient enzyme production but also exemplifies a circular approach by minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable resource efficiency to bioprocessing. This review offers a thorough examination of microbial pectinases, including their production from agro-industrial waste, their various industrial applications, and the current market landscape. It also delves into recent advancements in enzyme development and optimization techniques that have significantly boosted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of pectinase production.

The search for novel substrates is an ongoing quest, particularly for those residues that do not interfere with the food chain and do not need arable land. Here, a halophytic biomass from Arthrocnemum macrostachyum was utilized as a substrate to produce multienzyme preparation from two endophytic strains of Bacillus sp. TKE1 and TKE4. Initially, a one-factor-at-a-time approach was adopted to investigate the appropriate levels of the variables affecting enzyme production. Consequently, the central composite design was used to optimize the enzymes produced by the two strains. Among the enzymes studied, amylase and xylanase activity were found to have significant R2 values (> 90%) in ANOVA; hence, these were further optimized. Response surface optimization of the enzymes production resulted in the final titers of 4.3 IU mL−1 of amylase and 3.5 IU mL−1 of xylanase by TKE1 while 3.2 IU mL−1 of amylase and 2.9 IU mL−1 of xylanase by TKE4. The SEM analysis revealed the separation of substrate fibers, loosening of the matrix, porous, and increased contact surface. The FTIR results showed significant changes in the lignin-related bands (1518 to 1257 cm−1), changes in the bands for cellulosic component (1635.63 cm−1 and 1608.63 cm−1), starch content (1064.70 cm−1), and β-glycosidic linkage (848.67 and 864.10 cm−1), indicating the degradation of the substrate by the strains.

Most of these applications suffer from low thermal and storage stability of cellulase, contamination of products by enzyme and lake of enzyme reusability that make process inappropriate in economic viewpoint. For overcoming these issues and improve the stability and reusability of the enzyme, the immobilization methods could employ. Recently, the immobilization of cellulase on nanomaterials is under more considerable attention due to the significant surface properties of these supports. However, the application of these supports is also restricted by troubles in recovery, e.g., via centrifugation or filtration. This restriction could be solved using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that can simply separate from the reaction media by using a simple magnet. MNPs have been commonly used for enzyme immobilization in recent years due to this practical advantage and their low toxicity.

Due to the structural complexity of the lignocellulose and problems associated with physical and chemical methods of its pretreatments, there is an utmost need for an eco-friendly pretreatment strategy. Biological pretreatment involving microorganisms and their enzymes is an environment-benign and economic process due to lack of release or requirement of toxic chemicals during the process. Among microorganisms, filamentous fungi (mainly Basidiomycetes) with efficient enzymatic machinery have been used in efficient delignification and bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Enzyme-mediated pretreatment has further improved the saccharification of plant biomass with no sugar loss as in case of microbial pretreatment. Composting, ensiling, solid state fermentation, and biogas production are based on biological pretreatment, which are used for the generation of value-added products. Biological pretreatment does not require/release toxic chemicals but, is highly useful in detoxification of such toxic compounds. Biological pretreatment is significantly affected by biotic and abiotic factors. Pretreated biomass is hydrolyzed by cellulases and xylanases into sugars that are fermented into biofuels, organic acids, enzymes, and other products. The slow and long incubation nature of biological pretreatment has been overcome by combining with milder physico-chemical methods. Furthermore, the consolidated bioprocessing-based biorefinery approach has enhanced the potential of biological pretreatment by involving microbial consortium for the production of biofuels and other value-added products in a single step. Therefore, biological pretreatment-based biorefinery approach would be quite beneficial for the large-scale production of value-added products from lignocellulose with concomitant reduction in environmental pollution and solid waste management. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biological pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass: An environment-benign and sustainable approach for conversion of solid waste into value-added products","10.1080/10643389.2023.2277670","ENGLISH"

"KUMAR VA, 2019, GREEN BIO-PROCESSES: ENZYMES IN INDUSTRIAL FOOD PROCESSING","The activities of microbial enzymes have been observed and utilized for many centuries, but it has been only in relatively recent times that the use of microbial enzymes has been commercialized. Cellulases are a group of enzymes consisting of three major components, endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and beta-D-glucosidase of which endoglucanase acts on carboxymethyl cellulose causing random scission of cellulose chains yielding glucose and cello-oligosaccharides, exoglucanase acts on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) liberating cellobiose as the primary product beta-glucosidase works on cellobiose to release glucose. All these enzymes act synergistically to release glucose as end product. Cellulase has a wide range of applications in Industrial Biotechnology and is the second most used industrial enzyme after protease. In most of the cases, they are used in combination with other enzymes like pectinase, hemicellulase, ligninase, etc. Some of the most important applications of cellulase are in food, brewery and wine, animal feed, textile and laundry, pulp and paper industries, as well as in biomass hydrolysis, agriculture, and research purposes.

"LIU G, 2016, BIOPROCESS BIOSYST ENG","Cost reduction on cellulase enzyme usage has been the central effort in the commercialization of fuel ethanol production from lignocellulose biomass. Therefore, establishing an accurate evaluation method on cellulase enzyme cost is crucially important to support the health development of the future biorefinery industry. Currently, the cellulase cost evaluation methods were complicated and various controversial or even conflict results were presented. To give a reliable evaluation on this important topic, a rigorous analysis based on the Aspen Plus flowsheet simulation in the commercial scale ethanol plant was proposed in this study. The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) was used as the indicator to show the impacts of varying enzyme supply modes, enzyme prices, process parameters, as well as enzyme loading on the enzyme cost. The results reveal that the enzyme cost drives the cellulosic ethanol price below the minimum profit point when the enzyme is purchased from the current industrial enzyme market. An innovative production of cellulase enzyme such as on-site enzyme production should be explored and tested in the industrial scale to yield an economically sound enzyme supply for the future cellulosic ethanol production. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cost evaluation of cellulase enzyme for industrial-scale cellulosic ethanol production based on rigorous Aspen Plus modeling","10.1007/s00449-015-1497-1","ENGLISH"
"LIU H, 2024, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT RES","As a crucial hydrolytic enzyme, urease plays a vital role in anaerobic biological treatment. It is well-known that manganese ions are abundant in landfill leachate, but their concentration fluctuates significantly. However, few studies have investigated the effect and mechanism of different concentrations of Mn2+ on urease activity during anaerobic biological treatment of landfill leachate. This paper aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of different concentrations of Mn2+ on urease activity. The results showed that an appropriate amount of Mn2+ could significantly enhance urease activity, while a high concentration of Mn2+ could inhibit it. Insight into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, various methods such as Zeta potential, particle size, ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and statistical analysis were employed in our study. Research suggested that, on one hand, Mn2+ may form hydrogen bonds with the side chain amino or carboxyl groups of urease amino acid residues, affecting the structure of urease through hydrogen bonding. Additionally, Mn2+ also binds to urease through hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, the C–OH and C-N functional groups in urease have a strong affinity for Mn2+, and changes in these functional groups can greatly enhance the activity of urease. Furthermore, under the action of high concentrations of Mn2+, while the structure of urease becomes more stable, there is also a steric hindrance phenomenon that affects the substrate from entering the catalytic center. Therefore, studying the mechanism of Mn2+ affecting urease activity has significant biological significance and provides a new perspective for exploring the impact of metals on anaerobic bioprocessing of landfill leachate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Effect and mechanism of Mn2+ on urease activity during anaerobic biological treatment of landfill leachate","10.1007/s11356-024-33907-5","ENGLISH"

"LU H, 2022, CHEMOSPHERE","Current biorefinery approaches comprehend diverse biomass feedstocks and various conversion techniques to produce a variety of high-value biochemicals and biofuels. Lignocellulose is among the most abundant, bio-renewable, and sustainable bioresources on earth. It is regarded as a prodigious alternative raw feedstock to produce a large number of chemicals and biofuels. Producing biofuels and platform chemicals from lignocellulosic biomasses represent advantages in terms of energy and environmental perspectives. Lignocellulose is a main structural constituent of non-woody and woody plants consisting of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. Efficient exploitation of all these components is likely to play a considerable contribution to the economic viability of the processes since lignocellulosic biomass often necessitate pretreatment for liberating fermentable sugars and added value products that might serve as feedstocks for microbial strains to produce biofuels and biochemicals. Developing robust microbial culture and advancements in metabolic engineering approaches might lead to the rapid construction of cell factories for the effective biotechnological transformation of biomass feedstocks to produce biorefinery products. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the recent progress in the valorization of agro-industrial wastes as prospective microbial feedstocks to produce a spectrum of high-value products, such as microbial pigments, biopolymers, industrial biocatalysts, biofuels, biologically active compounds, bioplastics, biosurfactants, and biocontrol agents with therapeutic and industrial potentialities.

It can allow Americans to live longer, healthier lives, reduce our dependence on oil, address key environmental challenges, transform manufacturing processes, and increase the productivity and scope of the agricultural sector while growing new jobs and industries. Decades of life-sciences research and the development of increasingly powerful tools for obtaining and using biological data have brought us closer to the threshold of a previously unimaginable future: ""ready to burn"" liquid fuels produced directly from CO 2, biodegradable plastics made not from oil but from renewable biomass, tailored food products to meet specialized dietary requirements, personalized medical treatments based on a patient's own genomic information, and novel biosensors for real-time monitoring of the environment. Increasingly, scientists and engineers are looking to augment biological research with approaches from other scientific disciplines for solutions to our most demanding scientific and societal challenges and seeing exciting options that will profoundly affect our future. Technological innovation is a significant driver of economic growth, and the US bioeconomy represents a growing sector of this technologyfueled economy. Agriculture, one of the country's largest industries, is heavily based on advances in biological research and development (R&D). According to the USDA, US revenues in 2010 from genetically modified crops were approximately $76 billion.

"OGUNYEWO OA, 2020, APPL ENVIRON MICROBIOL 1","Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are crucial industrial enzymes required in the biorefinery industry as well as in the natural carbon cycle. These enzymes, known to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds, are produced by numerous bacterial and fungal species to assist in the degradation of cellulosic biomass. In this study, we annotated and performed structural analysis of an uncharacterized LPMO from Penicillium funiculosum (PfLPMO9) based on computational methods in an attempt to understand the behavior of this enzyme in biomass degradation. PfLPMO9 exhibited 75% and 36% sequence identities with LPMOs from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) and Lentinus similis (LsLPMO9A), respectively. Furthermore, multiple fungal genetic manipulation tools were employed to simultaneously overexpress LPMO and cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) in a catabolite-derepressed strain of Penicillium funiculosum, PfMig1(88) (an engineered variant of P. funiculosum), to improve its saccharification performance toward acid-pretreated wheat straw (PWS) at 20% substrate loading. The resulting transformants showed improved LPMO and CBH1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, with ∼200% and ∼66% increases in ascorbate-induced LPMO and Avicelase activities, respectively. While the secretome of PfMig(88) overexpressing LPMO or CBH1 increased the saccharification of PWS by 6% or 13%, respectively, over the secretome of PfMig1(88) at the same protein concentration, the simultaneous overexpression of these two genes led to a 20% increase in saccharification efficiency over that observed with PfMig1(88), which accounted for 82% saccharification of PWS under 20% substrate loading.IMPORTANCE The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass by cellulases continues to be a significant bottleneck in the development of second-generation biobased industries. While increasing efforts are being made to obtain indigenous cellulases for biomass hydrolysis, the high production cost of this enzyme remains a crucial challenge affecting its wide availability for the efficient utilization of cellulosic materials. This is because it is challenging to obtain an enzymatic cocktail with balanced activity from a single host.

The aim is to provide an insight and update of the state of biotechnology in Zimbabwe. This paper also aims to highlight the country's strengths and weaknesses in biotechnology research and development capacity. This information will help scientists, policy makers and regulators and other stakeholders understand the state of biotechnology in the country and serve to guide scientists who are interested in doing research in untapped areas of biotechnology in the country. Currently, Zimbabwe has a sizable number of research groups using biotechnology in a variety of areas. Current projects in agricultural biotechnology are mainly carried out at universities and public research institutes and are aimed at improving disease, herbicide, drought and insect resistance and for plant propagation. Especially plant tissue culture is widely used while work on genetic engineering is being carried in few laboratories. In food and beverages, biotechnological research is focussed on microbiology and biochemical processes and use of starter cultures during fermentation of traditional foods. Zimbabwe is being involved in industrial biotechnology in a limited fashion, through search and use of her biological resources as sources of potential industrial enzymes. Biotechnological researches with environmental relevance include decolouration of textile dyes, wastewater treatment and biogas production from municipal, industrial and agricultural waste (water). It is found that Zimbabwe's biotechnology is mainly traditional and most research organisations are applying less advanced biotechnology techniques. Poor infrastructure, lack of human resources and funding are the major challenges to modern biotechnology development in Zimbabwe, although biotechnology research development and management is more established in the country than in most of the sub-Saharan African countries. Zimbabwe has developed the legal framework to guide research and development of modern biotechnology through its National Biotechnology Authority Act (Act 3, 2006/ Chapter 14:31).

This paper also aims to highlight the country's strengths and weaknesses in biotechnology research and development capacity. This information will help scientists, policy makers and regulators and other stakeholders understand the state of biotechnology in the country and serve to guide scientists who are interested in doing research in untapped areas of biotechnology in the country. Currently, Zimbabwe has a sizable number of research groups using biotechnology in a variety of areas. Current projects in agricultural biotechnology are mainly carried out at universities and public research institutes and are aimed at improving disease, herbicide, drought and insect resistance and for plant propagation. Especially plant tissue culture is widely used while work on genetic engineering is being carried in few laboratories. In food and beverages, biotechnological research is focussed on microbiology and biochemical processes and use of starter cultures during fermentation of traditional foods. Zimbabwe is being involved in industrial biotechnology in a limited fashion, through search and use of her biological resources as sources of potential industrial enzymes. Biotechnological researches with environmental relevance include decolouration of textile dyes, wastewater treatment and biogas production from municipal, industrial and agricultural waste (water). It is found that Zimbabwe's biotechnology is mainly traditional and most research organisations are applying less advanced biotechnology techniques. Poor infrastructure, lack of human resources and funding are the major challenges to modern biotechnology development in Zimbabwe, although biotechnology research development and management is more established in the country than in most of the sub-Saharan African countries. Zimbabwe has developed the legal framework to guide research and development of modern biotechnology through its National Biotechnology Authority Act (Act 3, 2006/Chapter 14: 31). However, there is still need to develop a National Biotechnology Strategy if the country is to realise more benefits from biotechnology.","Biotechnology research, development, applications and management in Zimbabwe: Review",NA,"ENGLISH"

NHases convert nitriles to the corresponding amides. Although the structures of some forms of NHases containing nonheme low spin Fe(III) or low spin noncorrinoid Co(III) are known, neither a catalytic mechanism nor the reasons of high selectivity towards aromatic ligands are recognized. Optimized geometries, molecular electrostatic potential maps and infrared spectra of commercially important aromatic substrates of the NHase (nicotinonitrile, o-, m-, p-methylbenzonitrile) and the corresponding products (nicotinamide, o-, m-, p-methylbenzamid) were investigated using the density functional theory method with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.

Due to their potentials and very broad activities, this study isolated, investigated, and characterized the protease-and amylase-producing bacterial strain FW2 that was isolated from food waste. Strain FW2 belongs to the genus Bacillus and was found to be closest to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 7T with a similarity of 99.86%. This strain was able to degrade organic compounds at temperatures from −6◦ C to 75◦ C (but weak at 80◦ C) under a wide pH range (4.5–12) and high-salinity conditions up to 35% NaCl. Maximum enzyme production was obtained at 1200 ± 23.4 U/mL for protease and 2400 ± 45.8 U/mL for amylase for 4 days at pH 7–7.5, 40–45◦ C, and 0–10% NaCl.

"PINHEIRO DE SOUZA TS, 2023, CATAL LETT","Enzymes are versatile and ecological biocatalysts that are biodegradable, which leads to lower environmental impacts. Peptidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of peptide bonds in proteins. Protein hydrolysis is fundamental in food processing, cleaning products, and pharmaceuticals, among others. Microbial peptidases have been the preferred source for developing new enzymes, besides their advantages compared to plant or animal sources. This is owing to their characteristics, e.g., fast growth, wide diversity of microbial enzymes, longer shelf life, and potential for genetic manipulation of microorganisms. Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions and are highly specific. They generally work in mild conditions and depend on their native conditions, such as pH, temperature, and solvent characteristics. However, the protease used must tolerate operational adversities such as extreme pH and temperature in industrial processes. For this, it is necessary to discover new peptidases and improve existing ones. Methods of metagenomic selection and genome mining or through extremophile diversity (e.g., thermophilic, cold-active, alkali tolerant, acidophilic, and halophilic microorganisms) have been used in the discovery of new enzymes. Protein engineering (by directed evolution, rational design, semi-rational design, and de novo design) and enzyme immobilization are strategies used to improve the catalytic properties, efficiency, and stability of enzymes. This review aimed to critically discuss the current state of the art and future trends of microbial peptidases, highlighting their applications in food processing.

"RAMOS MDN, 2022, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV","Growing fossil raw material demand, especially for producing fuels, has caused serious damage to the environment, mainly in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To minimize non-renewable fuel use and impacts, biomasses can be used as substitutes to achieve a sustainable circular economy, especially in Brazil, which is one of the largest biomass producers in the world. Ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas/biomethane have been extensively studied as alternatives to fossil fuels, the two first being already produced at industrial scales and used as vehicle fuels in Brazil. Additionally, different biomasses have been used as raw materials to produce biofuels, and enzymatic catalysis have shown promising potential to achieve feasible and sustainable processes.

This research focuses on the identification and characterization of lignin-depolymerizing enzymes in Bacillus subtilis strain S11Y, previously isolated from palm oil wastes in Malaysia. The draft genome sequences of this highly lignin-depolymerizing strain revealed that the genome lacked any of the well-known dye-decolorizing peroxidase or catalase-peroxidase that are commonly reported to be involved in lignin depolymerization by bacteria, indicating that strain S11Y has distinct sets of potential lignin depolymerization genes. The oxidative stress-related enzymes Cu/Zn type-superoxide dismutase (Sod2) and a heme-containing monofunctional catalase (Kat2) were identified in the genome sequences that are of interest. Their lignin-depolymerizing ability were evaluated by treating Alkali lignin (AL) with each enzyme and their degradation ability were evaluated using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which successfully proved lignin depolymerizing ability.

However, while a number of clades have been investigated, the vast majority of the fungal kingdom remains unexplored for industrial applications. Here, we discuss selected classes of fungal enzymes that are currently in biotechnological use, and explore more basal, non-conventional fungi and their underexploited biomass-degrading mechanisms as promising agents in the transition towards a bio-based society. Of special interest are anaerobic fungi like the Neocallimastigomycota, which were recently found to harbor the largest diversity of biomass-degrading enzymes among the fungal kingdom. Enzymes sourced from these basal fungi have been used to metabolically engineer substrate utilization in yeast, and may offer new paths to lignin breakdown and tunneled biocatalysis. We also contrast classic enzymology approaches with emerging ‘omics’-based tools to decipher function within novel fungal isolates and identify new promising enzymes. Recent developments in genome editing are expected to accelerate discovery and metabolic engineering within these systems, yet are still limited by a lack of high-resolution genomes, gene regulatory regions, and even appropriate culture conditions.

We developed a systems-level approach that integrates transcriptomic sequencing, proteomics, phenotype, and biochemical studies of relatively unexplored basal fungi. Anaerobic gut fungi isolated from herbivores produce a large array of biomass-degrading enzymes that synergistically degrade crude, untreated plant biomass and are competitive with optimized commercial preparations from Aspergillus and Trichoderma. Compared to these model platforms, gut fungal enzymes are unbiased in substrate preference due to a wealth of xylan-degrading enzymes. These enzymes are universally catabolite-repressed and are further regulated by a rich landscape of noncoding regulatory RNAs. Additionally, we identified several promising sequence-divergent enzyme candidates for lignocellulosic bioprocessing.","Early-branching gut fungi possess a large, comprehensive array of biomass-degrading enzymes","10.1126/science.aad1431","ENGLISH"
"SOOCH BS, 2019, INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY: PLANT SYSTEMS, RESOURCES AND PRODUCTS","Recently, the utilization of agro-industrial lignocellulosic waste materials has received much attention for the production of value-added products like enzymes, organic acids and biofuels. Microbial-based environment-friendly approaches are receiving greater attention for the management of these waste materials in both developing and developed countries due to the increase in problems associated with industrialization and environmental pollution. Agro-industrial lignocellulosic biomass is renewable, inexpensive and abundant and hence can be used as a unique natural source for the cost-effective and large-scale production of these valuable products. Microbial and enzyme technology is one of the most promising approaches in the field of industrial biotechnology for the production of numerous commercial products. Currently, enzymes are extensively used in various industrial sectors like food, pharmaceutics, odontology, textile, detergent, bioremediation, paper and pulp, and wine and brewery. Many industries focused on the utilization of agro-based wastes containing lignocellulosic material as a substrate for the large-scale production of industrial enzymes through either solid-state or submerged fermentation. However, biomass transport, proper handling and pretreatment methods for delignification are some of the limitations associated with the use of lignocellulosic materials. Recently, there has been a resurgence in the utilization of various agricultural wastes like sugarcane baggase, wheat straw, wheat bran, rice straw, rice bran, corn cobs, corn stover, banana waste, hardwood, softwood, newspaper, office paper, groundnut shell, coffee by-products, sweet sorghum and grasses for the cost-effective production of enzymes with better yield and novel activity, which can help to bring sustainability in the agriculture sector. Further improvements in enzyme technology can be achieved by incorporating desirable characteristics through some latest techniques like in silico characterization, regulation of metabolic flux, recombinant DNA technology and microarray technology. This chapter describes the biotechnological importance of the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of industrial enzymes.","Agro-industrial lignocellulosic residues for the production of industrial enzymes","10.1515/9783110563337-002","ENGLISH"
"SOUZA TSP, 2023, CATAL LETT","Enzymes are versatile and ecological biocatalysts that are biodegradable, which leads to lower environmental impacts. Peptidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of peptide bonds in proteins. Protein hydrolysis is fundamental in food processing, cleaning products, and pharmaceuticals, among others. Microbial peptidases have been the preferred source for developing new enzymes, besides their advantages compared to plant or animal sources. This is owing to their characteristics, e.g., fast growth, wide diversity of microbial enzymes, longer shelf life, and potential for genetic manipulation of microorganisms. Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions and are highly specific. They generally work in mild conditions and depend on their native conditions, such as pH, temperature, and solvent characteristics. However, the protease used must tolerate operational adversities such as extreme pH and temperature in industrial processes. For this, it is necessary to discover new peptidases and improve existing ones. Methods of metagenomic selection and genome mining or through extremophile diversity (e.g., thermophilic, cold-active, alkali tolerant, acidophilic, and halophilic microorganisms) have been used in the discovery of new enzymes. Protein engineering (by directed evolution, rational design, semi-rational design, and de novo design) and enzyme immobilization are strategies used to improve the catalytic properties, efficiency, and stability of enzymes. This review aimed to critically discuss the current state of the art and future trends of microbial peptidases, highlighting their applications in food processing.

"SRIVASTAVA N, 2019, BIOMOLECULES","The biomass to biofuels production process is green, sustainable, and an advanced technique to resolve the current environmental issues generated from fossil fuels. The production of biofuels from biomass is an enzyme mediated process, wherein β-glucosidase (BGL) enzymes play a key role in biomass hydrolysis by producing monomeric sugars from cellulose-based oligosaccharides. However, the production and availability of these enzymes realize their major role to increase the overall production cost of biomass to biofuels production technology. Therefore, the present review is focused on evaluating the production and efficiency of β-glucosidase enzymes in the bioconversion of cellulosic biomass for biofuel production at an industrial scale, providing its mechanism and classification. The application of BGL enzymes in the biomass conversion process has been discussed along with the recent developments and existing issues. Moreover, the production and development of microbial BGL enzymes have been explained in detail, along with the recent advancements made in the field. Finally, current hurdles and future suggestions have been provided for the future developments. This review is likely to set a benchmark in the area of cost effective BGL enzyme production, specifically in the biorefinery area. © 2019 by the authors.

Recycling and valorizing plastic waste via the thermochemical route is a promising approach. In this work, we report the preparation of activated carbon (AC) based catalyst using lab-used, microbiologically discarded petri dish plates and characterized through XRD, FTIR, BET, SEM, and TEM techniques. Further, a comparative application of this activated AC catalyst has been studied in enzyme production through solid-state fermentation using open aerobic microbial culture (OAC) and a lab-isolated fungal culture Rhizopus oryzae NS5 (RO). Cellulase enzyme production with filter paper activity (FPA) of 28 IU/gds and 25 IU/gds FPA were noticed on day three of microbial fermentation using 0.5 mg AC catalyst in the case of OAC and RO systems, respectively. The crude cellulase enzyme obtained from OAC using 1 mg concentration in SSF reflected thermal stability at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, showing 42 \% and 36 \% of relative enzyme activity, along with 58 \% of relative activity at pH 5.0 for 20 h at 50 degrees C.

"SUHAILI N, 2019, J CHEM TECHNOL BIOTECHNOL 1","BACKGROUND: This work explores the feasibility of vinasse as an inexpensive feedstock for industrial biocatalyst production within the context of an integrated sugar beet biorefinery. As an exemplar, production of CV2025 ω-Transaminase (ω-TAm) in Escherichia coli BL21 was studied. RESULTS: Characterisation of vinasse showed that it comprised mainly of glycerol along with several reducing sugars, sugar alcohols, acetate, polyphenols and protein. Preliminary results showed E. coli BL21 cell growth and CV2025 ω-TAm production were feasible in cultures using 17% to 25% (v/v) vinasse with higher concentrations demonstrating inhibitory effects. The d-galactose present in vinasse facilitated auto-induction of the pQR801 plasmid enabling CV2025 ω-TAm expression without addition of expensive Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Assessment of different vinasse pre-processing options confirmed simple dilution of the vinasse was sufficient to reduce the concentration of polyphenols to below inhibitory levels. Optimisation experiments, carried out using a controlled, 24-well microbioreactor platform, showed supplementation of diluted vinasse medium with 10 g L                             −1                              yeast extract enabled enhancements of 2.8, 2.5, 5.4 and 3-fold in specific growth rate, maximum biomass concentration, CV2025 ω-TAm volumetric and specific activity, respectively. Investigation into the metabolic preferences of E. coli BL21 when grown in vinasse showed a preference for D-mannitol utilisation before simultaneous metabolism of glycerol, d-xylitol, d-dulcitol and acetate.

The results showed good comparability with respect to cell growth, substrate consumption and CV2025 ω-TAm production representing over a 700-fold volumetric scale translation.

"TRULEA A, 2016, AGROLIFE SCI J","Production of bioenergy from lignocellulosic biomass has gained more and more interest over the past years. Due to its high content in carbohydrates, Sorghum bicolor is one of the best suited candidate for bioenergy production. However, the lignocellulosic nature of the sorghum biomass raises difficulties to the access of the microbial enzymes to cellulose and hemicellulose and inhibits processes such as hydrolysis, fermentation and anaerobic digestion of biomass to produce biofuels. In this study, the effects of thermo - chemical pretreatment (mild alkaline pretreatment), applied to improve biodegradability of three different hybrids of sorghum biomass were investigated. Alkaline pretreatment have positive effects on the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, increasing both cellulose and hemicellulose content while breaking the lignocellulosic bonds and reducing lignin content. The achieved methane yields ranged from 320 to 345 l(n) CH4/kg VS for the pretreated biomass, approximately 22\% higher than the yields obtained from the untreated biomass. Important increase of methane production has been noticed as well in the case of anaerobic digestion of spent bagasse resulted after ethanol fermentation.

Methodology and results: Three bacterial isolates K1, K5 and K7 were found promising protease producers. These isolates were preliminary identified as Bacillus based on morphological characteristics and biochemical tests (positive for catalase, oxidase and citrate tests, and negative for indole and urease tests). The isolates K1, K5 and K7 were further identified as Priestia endophytica, Lysinibacillus cresolivorans and Bacillus subtilis, respectively by phylogenetic analysis. The isolates grew best at 50 degrees C and P. endophytica (K1), L. cresolivorans (K5) and B. subtilis (K7) produced larger zones of hydrolysis at 37 degrees C, 45 degrees C and 50 degrees C at pH 7, respectively. The optimum temperature where protease activity was maximum was 65 degrees C for P. endophytica and L. cresolivorans and 55 degrees C for B. subtilis, and the optimum pH was 9. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The proteases produced by these isolates were found active at high temperatures (45 degrees C to 85 degrees C) and high pH (9-12), which make them industrially important thermoalkaliphilic proteases.

This study examined the individual and mixture efficiencies of two hemicellulolytic microbial enzymes and two xylanase preparations in catalyzing degradation of green liquor (GL) and hot water (HW) pre-pulping extracts. The effects of four commercial enzyme preparations were determined by assessing yields of xylose + galactose + mannose (xmg) obtained under different reaction conditions. Of the individual enzyme preparations tested, a sample NS 50012 was superior to the other enzyme preparations in releasing xmg under conditions optimized for separate hydrolysis and fermentation and for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. In comparison to pre-pulping extracts treated with HW, extract treated with GL was found to inhibit the action of all tested enzymes. This inhibition may be related to higher salt and lignin phenol in the GL extract. On both types of extracts, the mixture constituted by NS 50012 and NS 50030 provided the highest yield of hemicellulose conversion at 55 °C and pH 5.5.

"VIGNESWARAN C, 2011, TEXT APPAREL TECHNOL MANAGE","Environmental consciousness is one of the major concerns for textile wet processing industry as the industry contributes much to industrial pollution problems facing the country. Such pollutants as such as lime, sodium sulfide, salt, solvents, synthetic pigments come mainly from desizing, scouring, bleaching and dyeing processes in textile wet processing. In order to overcome the hazards caused by the chemical effluents, use of enzymes as a viable alternative has been resorted to in preparatory dyeing operations such as desizing, scouring, and bleaching treatments. This review focuses on the use of microbial enzymes as an alternate technology to the conventional methods, and highlights the importance of these enzymes in minimizing the pollution load. Environmental pollution has been a major irritant to industrial development. Also in this paper we have discussed the advantages and limitations of bioprocessing techniques in the various textile wet processing such as desizing, scouring, bleaching, biopolishing, bio-singeing and bio-decoloration in the dyeing effluents for cellulosic and non-cellulosic materials.","Biovision in textile wet processing industry- technological challenges",NA,"ENGLISH"

"VODOVNIK M, 2020, ACTA AGRIC SLOVENICA","Global energy demands and global warming represent key challenges of the future of human society. Continous renewable energy supply is key for sustainable economy development. Waste plant biomass represent abundant source of renewable energy that can be transformed to biofuels and other value-added products, which is currently limited due to the lack of cost-effective biocatalysts. The bottleneck of this process is the degradation of structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls to soluble compounds that can be fermented to solvents or transformed to biogas via methanogenesis and can be used as biofuels or chemical raw materials. In order to replace traditional physical and chemical methods of lignocellulose pretreatment with more environmentally friendly biological approaches, native microbial enzyme systems are increasingly being explored as potential biocatalysts that could be used in these processes. Microbial enzymes are useful either as catalysts in the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses or as components incorporated in engineered microbes for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocelluloses. The unprecedented development of tools for genetic and metabolic engineering for a wide range of microorganisms enabled significant progress in the development of microbial cell factories optimized for the producton of biofuels. One of the most promising strategies aimed towards this goal, i.e. systematic design and heterologous expression of »designer cellulosomes« in industrial solventogenic strains is adressed in detail. © 2020 University of Ljubljana.

Typical cases where traditional processing industry was promoted by the development and application of enzyme and green biological technologies were also presented. It is envisioned that development of these core technologies will enable more traditional processing industries transform into green and sustainable bio-based industry.","[Developments of core technologies in industrial enzymes and green bioprocessing].","10.13345/J.CJB.220591","CHI"
"ZHOU X, 2019, INT J MOL SCI","Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes in both the natural carbon cycle and the biorefinery industry. Understanding the molecular basis of LPMOs acting on polysaccharide substrates is helpful for improving industrial cellulase cocktails. Here we analyzed the sequences, structures, and substrate binding modes of LPMOs to uncover the factors that influence substrate specificity and regioselectivity. Our results showed that the different compositions of a motif located on L2 affect the electrostatic potentials of substrate binding surfaces, which in turn affect substrate specificities of AA10 LPMOs. A conserved Asn at a distance of 7 Å from the active center Cu might, together with the conserved Ser immediately before the second catalytic His, determine the localization of LPMOs on substrate, and thus contribute to C4-oxidizing regioselectivity. The findings in this work provide an insight into the molecular basis of substrate specificity and regioselectivity of LPMOs. © 2019 by the authors.

"ÁNGEL SILES LÓPEZ J, 2010, CRIT REV BIOTECHNOL","Up to comparatively recently orange peel and the associated residual remnants of membranes resulting from juice extraction represented a significant disposal problem, especially in those regions where orange cultivation is a major industry. However, recent research has demonstrated that orange peel waste represents a potentially valuable resource that can be developed into high value products. These developments are critically reviewed in this article. This includes a summary of the chemical composition of the substrate and an assessment of the range of applications in which the peel is deployed. Utilization as a substrate to produce animal feed, fertilizer, essential oils, pectin, ethanol, methane, industrial enzymes, and single cell protein is discussed. The applications described together with those that will no doubt be developed in the future, represent great opportunities to harness the economical benefit of this agro-industrial waste and to develop even more efficient and sustainable systems. A scheme of integrated utilization of orange peel in a biorefinery approach is discussed together with some prediction of further necessary research. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","Biorefinery of waste orange peel","10.3109/07388550903425201","ENGLISH"
